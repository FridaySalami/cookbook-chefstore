## Why You'll Love This

It’s the kind of dish that feels fancy but cooks in one pan in under 15.  
Crispy fish, buttery sauce, a lemony caper pop on every bite—bright enough for summer, rich enough for any night.

## Ingredients

- 2 sea bass fillets, skin on  
- Salt & pepper  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tbsp butter  

### For the Lemon Caper Butter

- 30g butter  
- Juice of ½ lemon  
- Zest of 1 lemon  
- 1 tbsp Lefktro Capote Capers, rinsed and chopped  
- 1 small garlic clove, finely grated  
- 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped  

## Instructions

### 1. Cook the Sea Bass

1. Pat fillets dry and season the skin side with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
3. Place fish skin-side down and cook 3–4 minutes without moving.
4. Flip and cook another 1–2 minutes until just cooked through.
5. Remove and rest, skin-side up.

### 2. Make the Sauce

1. In the same pan, reduce heat to low.
2. Add lemon juice, zest, garlic, and capers. Let it bubble gently.
3. Whisk in butter until melted and emulsified.
4. Stir in parsley and spoon over the fish to serve.

## Tips

- Goes great with crushed potatoes, wilted spinach, or seasonal greens.  
- Make it dairy-free by using olive oil only—still sings.  
- Capers too bold? Cut with a little white wine in the sauce.

## Goes Great With

- Roasted tenderstem or grilled courgettes  
- A glass of cold white wine  
- A night in that tastes like going out
