## Why You'll Love This

Soft, buttery leeks. Tender, thin-sliced potatoes.  
And that moment when the cream bubbles up, the cheese melts down, and the top goes golden and crisp?  
Yeah. This one’s a keeper.

## Ingredients

- 500g potatoes (waxy or all-purpose), peeled and thinly sliced  
- 2 leeks, trimmed and finely sliced  
- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter  
- 100ml Essential Cuisine Vegetable Stock  
- 200ml Kerrymaid UHT Double Cream  
- 100g grated mature cheddar (or any good melting cheese)  
- 2 tbsp Centaur Panko Breadcrumbs  
- ½ tsp Chef William Dried Sage  
- Salt & black pepper to taste  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan).
2. Heat oil or butter in a pan. Add sliced leeks and cook gently for 6–8 minutes until soft.
3. In a jug, mix cream, stock, sage, salt, and pepper.
4. Layer half the sliced potatoes in a greased baking dish. Top with half the leeks and a handful of cheese.
5. Repeat with remaining potatoes, leeks, and cheese. Pour over the cream mixture.
6. Sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top and an extra dusting of cheese if you like.
7. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake uncovered for 15 minutes until golden and bubbling.
8. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

## Tips

- Add cooked bacon or ham between layers for a meaty twist.  
- Swap cream for plant-based if needed (Flora or Macphie both work).  
- Add a spoonful of mustard to the cream for extra depth.
