Serve it warm and watch the hands fly.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 500g strong white bread flour  
- 1 sachet (7g) Dried Fermipan Yeast  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp sugar  
- 300ml warm water  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  

### For the Garlic Herb Butter
- 60g butter, melted  
- 1 tsp Chef William Garlic Powder  
- 1 tsp Chef William Dried Sage  
- 1 tsp Old India Dried Coriander Leaves  
- Pinch of salt  
- Optional: sprinkle of grated cheese or sesame seeds  

## Instructions

### 1. Make the Dough

1. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, sugar, and yeast (keep yeast and salt separate at first).
2. Add warm water and olive oil. Mix to form a soft dough.
3. Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Cover and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

### 2. Shape the Rolls

1. Knock back the dough and divide into small balls (about golf ball size).
2. Roll gently and arrange in a greased baking tin or skillet, spaced slightly apart.
3. Cover loosely and let rise again for 30 minutes while the oven preheats.

### 3. Bake and Butter

1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan).
2. Mix melted butter with garlic powder, dried sage, coriander, and salt.
3. Brush the dough balls generously with half the butter mix.
4. Bake for 20–25 minutes until golden and puffed.
5. Brush with remaining butter while still warm.

## Tips

- Serve warm with dips, soups, or to mop up sauces.  
- Want it cheesy? Sprinkle parmesan or cheddar over the top before baking.  
- Freeze after baking, then warm through before serving for make-ahead magic.
