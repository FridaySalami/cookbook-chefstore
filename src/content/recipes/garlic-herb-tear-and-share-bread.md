### 2. Shape and Second Rise

2. Roll each into a smooth ball. Arrange in a greased baking tin or skillet, spaced just slightly apart so they’ll rise together.
3. Cover loosely and leave for another 30 minutes until puffed and touching.

### 3. Bake and Finish

1. Preheat oven to 200°C fan.

3. Brush half of the butter mixture over the dough balls.
4. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown on top and sounding hollow when tapped.
