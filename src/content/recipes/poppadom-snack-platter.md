## Why You'll Love This

You ever fry a poppadom and watch it puff up like a golden balloon? It’s magic—kitchen alchemy with a crunch. This platter takes those poppadoms and loads ‘em up with colour, flavour, and personality. Serve it as a starter, a snack, or just somethin’ to nibble while the curry simmers.

## Ingredients

- 6–8 uncooked [Chefstore poppadoms](https://www.thechefstoreuk.com/products/triple-lion-plain-uncooked-poppadoms1kg?_pos=1&_sid=4a1d4b8a3&_ss=r)  
- Vegetable oil, for frying  
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped  
- 1 tomato, deseeded and diced  
- Fresh coriander, chopped  
- Lime wedges, to serve  

**Optional Toppings:**  
- Mango chutney  
- Mint raita  
- Tamarind sauce  
- Crumbled paneer or feta  
- Chopped green chilies  

## Instructions

1. Heat 2–3 inches of oil in a deep pan until a tiny piece of poppadom bubbles instantly (about 180°C / 350°F).
2. One at a time, slide a poppadom into the oil. Fry for 5–10 seconds—it should puff up and turn crisp almost immediately.
3. Remove with tongs and drain on kitchen paper. Repeat with the rest.
4. Arrange your poppadoms on a large platter.
5. Sprinkle with onion, tomato, fresh coriander, and anything else that takes your fancy.
6. Serve with lime wedges and small bowls of chutney, mint sauce, or whatever you’ve got handy.

## Tips

- Use tongs and keep your face back—these babies puff fast.
- Want to skip frying? Pop 'em in the microwave one at a time for 40–60 seconds on a plate. Still crispy, no oil.
- Add a little chat masala or cumin powder for a street food twist.
