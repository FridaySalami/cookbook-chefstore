## Why You'll Love This

It’s lemony, silky, and sets like magic—no eggs, no gelatin, just citrus sorcery.  
Topped with a buttery crumble, it walks the line between elegant dinner party and “I had lemons to use up.”

## Ingredients

### For the Posset
- 600ml Kerrymaid UHT Double Cream  
- 150g Tate & Lyle Caster Sugar  
- Zest of 1 lemon  
- Juice of 2 lemons  

### For the Shortbread Crumble (optional)
- 50g plain flour  
- 30g cold butter  
- 20g Tate & Lyle Caster Sugar  
- Pinch of salt  

## Instructions

### 1. Make the Posset

1. In a saucepan, gently heat the cream and sugar until just simmering. Stir to dissolve.
2. Once sugar is fully dissolved and the mix just starts to bubble, remove from heat.
3. Stir in lemon zest and juice. The acid will thicken the cream.
4. Pour into ramekins or glasses and chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.

### 2. Make the Crumble

1. Rub butter into flour with fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs.
2. Stir in sugar and a pinch of salt.
3. Bake at 180°C (fan) on a lined tray for 10–12 minutes or until golden. Cool, then crumble.

### 3. Serve

Top each posset with a spoonful of crumble just before serving for a contrast of textures.

## Tips

- Add crushed berries or a raspberry coulis for colour and tartness.  
- Swap lemon for lime or blood orange if you're feelin’ fancy.  
- Store possets covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.
