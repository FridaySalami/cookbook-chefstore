## Why You'll Love This

It’s everything you want from a tiramisu, but simpler.  
No eggs, no fuss just layers of cool mascarpone cream and coffee soaked sponge, dusted in cocoa like a secret.  
The kind of dessert that makes you pause between bites. The kind you eat slowly, even if you didn’t plan to.

## Ingredients

- 250g Mascarpone  
- 300ml Double Cream  
- 75g Icing Sugar  
- 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract  
- 250ml Strong Brewed Coffee, Cooled  
- 2 Tbsp Coffee Liqueur (Optional)  
- 200g Savoiardi Balocco Sponge Fingers  
- Cocoa Powder, For Dusting

## Instructions

1. **Make the cream.**  
   In a large bowl, whisk together the mascarpone, double cream, icing sugar, and vanilla extract.  
   You’re aiming for soft peaks, thick and smooth enough to spread, but still gentle.

2. **Mix the coffee soak.**  
   In a shallow dish, combine the cooled coffee with the liqueur if you’re using it.  
   Keep it close, you’ll need to move quickly when dipping.

3. **Start layering.**  
   Dip each sponge finger into the coffee mixture just for a second—enough to darken, not to collapse.  
   Lay them snug in the base of a serving dish, breaking a few if you need to fill the gaps.

4. **Add cream and repeat.**  
   Spoon over half the mascarpone cream and smooth it out. Add another layer of dipped sponge fingers. Finish with the rest of the cream, spreading gently to the edges.

5. **Chill.**  
   Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours overnight is even better.  
   This rest allows the layers to meld and the texture to settle into silk.

6. **Dust and serve.**  
   Just before serving, sift a thick blanket of cocoa powder over the top.  
   Serve chilled, with spoons and silence.


## Tips

- Grate dark chocolate between layers for texture and a little bitter contrast.  
- Make it in individual glasses for clean plating (and easier fridge storage).  
- Use decaf coffee if little ones are joining in or if it’s a late-night bite.

## Goes Great With

- A hot espresso or splash of amaretto  
- A quiet night in and low lighting  
- That last bite you eat slower than all the rest
