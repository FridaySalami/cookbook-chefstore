## Why You'll Love This

These sausage rolls aren’t messing about.  
They come wrapped in golden pastry, sure, but inside is a filling that brings warmth, boldness, and just the right lift of mint.  
Cumin and coriander give a deep, earthy rhythm. Cinnamon adds a hum of sweetness underneath. And then the tahini mint yoghurt comes in, cool, creamy, and a little tangy to tie it all together.

They’re at home on a party platter, in a packed lunch, or eaten standing at the counter before they’ve even cooled.  
Comfort food, with a bit of flair. Honest and flaky, with just enough spice to make you pause.

## Ingredients

### For the Sausage Rolls

- 500g Lamb Mince  
- 1 Small Onion  
- 2 Garlic Cloves  
- 1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin  
- 1 Teaspoon Ground Coriander  
- 1 Teaspoon Smoked Paprika  
- 1/2 Teaspoon Cinnamon  
- 1 Tablespoon Mint Sauce  
- 2 Tablespoons Chopped Fresh Mint or Parsley  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 1 Sheet Ready-Rolled Puff Pastry  
- 1 Egg  
- Sesame Seeds (Optional)  

### For the Mint Tahini Yoghurt Dip

- 2 Tablespoons Tahini  
- 3 Tablespoons Natural Yoghurt  
- 1 Teaspoon Mint Sauce  
- 1 Teaspoon Lemon Juice  
- Salt  

## Instructions

### Make the Filling

1. Add the lamb mince to a large bowl. Grate the onion and garlic directly into the bowl.  
2. Sprinkle over the cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper.  
3. Add the mint sauce and herbs. Mix everything together with your hands or a fork until just combined. Don’t overwork it.

### Shape and Bake

4. Preheat your oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with parchment.  
5. Unroll the puff pastry and cut lengthways into two even strips.  
6. Divide the lamb filling in half and form each half into a long sausage shape down the middle of each pastry strip.  
7. Brush one long edge of the pastry with water. Fold the other side over the filling and press to seal. Place seam-side down.  
8. Slice into individual rolls. Brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds if using.  
9. Arrange on the tray and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.

### Make the Dip

10. In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, yoghurt, mint sauce, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt.  
11. If the dip is too thick, add a splash of cold water to loosen it to your liking.

## Tips

- Assemble the rolls ahead and freeze before baking. Bake straight from frozen—just add 5 to 10 extra minutes in the oven.  
- Add a pinch of chilli flakes or a spoonful of harissa to the lamb for extra heat.  
- Serve with crisp salad leaves or pickled onions for brightness and crunch.
