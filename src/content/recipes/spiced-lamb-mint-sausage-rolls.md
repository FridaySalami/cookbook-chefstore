## Why You'll Love This

These rolls walk the line between **proper pub food** and **midweek marvel**.  
They’re flaky and rich, spiced with cumin and coriander, and cooled off with a tangy tahini-mint yoghurt dip.  
Serve 'em hot, warm, or smuggled into a lunchbox.

## Ingredients

### For the Sausage Rolls
- 500g lamb mince  
- 1 small onion, finely grated  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- ½ tsp cinnamon  
- 1 tbsp Colman's Mint Sauce  
- 2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley or mint (or 1 tsp dried mint)  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- 1 sheet ready-rolled puff pastry  
- 1 egg, beaten (for glazing)  
- Sesame seeds, for topping (optional)

### For the Mint Tahini Yoghurt Dip
- 2 tbsp Lefktro Tahini  
- 3 tbsp natural yoghurt  
- 1 tsp Colman’s Mint Sauce  
- 1 tsp lemon juice  
- Salt to taste  

## Instructions

### 1. Make the Filling

1. In a bowl, mix lamb, onion, garlic, spices, mint sauce, herbs, salt and pepper.
2. Combine well but don’t overwork it—just enough to bring it together.

### 2. Roll and Bake

1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan).
2. Unroll puff pastry and cut lengthwise into two long strips.
3. Divide the lamb mixture in half and form into logs down the centre of each strip.
4. Fold pastry over and seal edges with water. Place seam-side down.
5. Cut into rolls, glaze with beaten egg, and sprinkle sesame seeds if using.
6. Bake on parchment-lined tray for 20–25 minutes until golden and cooked through.

### 3. Make the Dip

1. Whisk together tahini, yoghurt, mint sauce, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt until smooth.
2. Add a splash of water if needed to loosen.

## Tips

- These freeze brilliantly—assemble raw, freeze on trays, then bag and bake from frozen.
- Fancy it hotter? Add chilli flakes or harissa to the lamb mix.
- Serve with pickles or a chopped salad to freshen things up.
