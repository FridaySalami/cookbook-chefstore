## Instructions

### ðŸ”¥ Oven Method (Low & Slow)

1. Preheat oven to 160Â°C (fan) / 180Â°C (conventional).
2. Heat neutral oil in a deep, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven. Sear the ribs on both sides until golden.
3. Add garlic, ginger, soy sauces, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, five spice, and water or stock.
4. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly with a lid or foil.
5. Transfer to oven and braise for **2 hours**, turning ribs halfway.
6. Remove the lid and return to oven for **15â€“20 mins** to reduce sauce and get sticky.
7. Garnish with spring onions, sesame seeds, or chilli. Serve with rice, slaw, or bao buns.

### âš¡ Pressure Cooker Method (Fast & Furious)

1. Set pressure cooker (or Instant Pot) to sautÃ© mode. Sear ribs in oil until browned.
2. Add garlic, ginger, soy sauces, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, five spice, and stock.
3. Lock lid, cook on **high pressure for 35 minutes**.
4. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release.
5. Remove lid and switch back to sautÃ© mode. Simmer for **10â€“15 mins** to reduce sauce until sticky and glossy.
6. Finish with garnishes and serve hot.

## Tips

- Want more caramelisation? Pop ribs under a hot grill for 5 minutes after cooking.
- Got leftovers? Shred the meat and stuff it into bao buns or rice bowls.
- Five spice adds warmthâ€”skip it if you're keepin' it simple.
