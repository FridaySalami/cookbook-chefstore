## Why You'll Love This

This mousse doesn’t shout.  
It floats in quietly, all softness and smooth charm, then melts into something more, something that stays with you.

It’s rich without being heavy.  
Sweet but not cloying.  
Each spoonful is like a whisper of cocoa wrapped in silk. And the best part? It comes together with barely a fuss.  

No baking. No stress. Just melt, mix, and chill.  
Whether it’s a Tuesday treat or the closing note to a dinner with friends, this mousse holds its own, light as air and deeply satisfying.

## Ingredients

- 200g Milk Chocolate Callets  
- 300ml Double Cream  
- 2 Large Eggs  
- 2 Tablespoons Sugar  
- A Pinch of Salt  

### Optional Garnishes

- Shaved Chocolate  
- Fresh Raspberries  
- Crushed Biscuits  

## Instructions

1. **Melt the chocolate**  
   Place the chocolate callets in a heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water. Stir gently until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.

2. **Add the egg yolks**  
   Once the chocolate has cooled slightly, stir in the egg yolks one at a time until fully incorporated. The mixture should look glossy and thick.

3. **Whip the cream**  
   In a separate bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks. It should hold shape but still feel billowy.

4. **Beat the egg whites**  
   In a third bowl, whisk the egg whites with the sugar and a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form. The mixture should stand tall on the whisk.

5. **Fold in the cream**  
   Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture using a spatula. Take your time, small circles, soft hands.

6. **Fold in the egg whites**  
   Add the beaten egg whites in two batches, folding carefully to keep the mixture light and airy.

7. **Chill the mousse**  
   Spoon into small ramekins or glasses and place in the fridge to chill for at least 2 hours, or until set.

8. **Serve and garnish**  
   Just before serving, top with cream, shaved chocolate, berries, or a crumble of biscuits—whatever brings you joy.

## Tips

- Let the chocolate cool slightly before adding the yolks to avoid scrambling them.  
- Don’t rush the folding this is what keeps the mousse light.  
- Add a splash of espresso or a teaspoon of liqueur to the melted chocolate for a deeper finish.
