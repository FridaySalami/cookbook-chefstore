## Why You'll Love This

It’s gooey. It’s creamy. It’s got sweet tang from the chutney and crunch from the crust.  
This is the kind of thing that makes people gather round with a slice of bread and not want to leave.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole Camembert (in a wooden box if possible)  
- 2–3 tbsp Bay Tree Cheeseboard Chutney  
- A few sprigs fresh thyme (optional)  
- Crusty bread, crackers, or toasted baguette, to serve  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan).
2. If using a wooden box, remove any plastic and place Camembert back in the box base. Score the top in a criss-cross pattern.
3. Place on a baking tray and bake for 15–20 minutes until soft in the centre.
4. Remove from oven and top with Bay Tree Cheeseboard Chutney.
5. Scatter with thyme if using. Serve immediately with bread for dipping.

## Tips

- Want to get fancy? Stud with garlic slivers or drizzle with honey before baking.  
- Try it with Bay Tree Spicy Onion Marmalade for a bolder bite.  
- No Camembert box? Wrap in baking paper and foil to contain the melt.

## Goes Great With

- A crisp glass of white wine or dry cider  
- Pickles, charcuterie, or roasted grapes  
- Fireside snacks or Sunday starter spreads
