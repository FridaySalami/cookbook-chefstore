## Why You'll Love This

It’s soft. It’s spoonable. It’s got tang, warmth, and enough gooey charm to turn any table into a gathering.  
The chutney lifts the richness, the thyme adds a whisper of woodland, and the bread? That’s your shovel to scoop it all up.  
One bake and you’ll be hooked.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole Camembert
- 2–3 tbsp Bay Tree Cheeseboard Chutney  
- A few thyme sprigs (optional)  
- Crusty bread, crackers, or toasted baguette, to serve

## Instructions


1. **Preheat your oven to 180°C (fan).**  
   This allows the cheese to melt slowly and evenly.

2. **Unwrap the Camembert and place it in the base of its wooden box.**  
   Discard any plastic wrapping. If there’s no box, wrap the cheese in baking paper and foil to contain the melt.

3. **Score the top of the rind with a sharp knife in a criss cross pattern.**  
   This helps the heat reach the creamy centre and makes it easier to spoon once baked.

4. **Set the box on a baking tray and bake for 15–20 minutes.**  
   It’s ready when the middle feels soft and molten to the touch. If it starts to bulge or leak, you’re right on time.

5. **Carefully remove from oven and spoon the chutney over the top.**  
   Let the heat warm it through it’ll mingle with the cheese like old friends.

6. **Scatter with thyme if using and serve immediately.**  
   Get the bread in there while it’s hot and drippy.

## Tips

- **Tuck in garlic slivers** before baking for a mellow, roasted depth.  
- **Drizzle with honey** before the oven for that sweet-meets-savoury hit.  
- **Switch up the chutney** Bay Tree Spicy Onion Marmalade brings a sharper contrast.  
- **Don’t overbake.** If it’s bubbling like lava and looks greasy, it’s gone too far.

## Goes Great With

- A **chilled white wine** (Sauvignon Blanc or Chenin Blanc) or a **dry cider**  
- **Pickles, charcuterie**, or even **roasted grapes** for a pop of sweetness  
- A **fireside evening**, or as the **centrepiece of a Sunday spread**
