## Why You'll Love This

This is one of those pastas that doesn’t need much — just a little heat, a splash of cream, and a quiet moment at the stove. The mushrooms bring depth and softness. The garlic builds warmth, not sharpness. And the tagliatelle catches every drop of sauce in its silky ribbons.

It feels a little indulgent but never too much. A dinner that comes together in less than half an hour, yet still makes you slow down when you eat it.  

Whether it’s the end of a long day or a quiet moment for yourself, this one says “You’re home now.” And that’s reason enough.

## Ingredients

- 250g Tagliatelle  
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  
- 300g Mushrooms  
- 3 Garlic Cloves  
- 150ml Double Cream  
- 50g Grated Cheese (Parmesan or Blend)  
- 1 Teaspoon Fine Sea Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- Fresh Parsley (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta.**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook until just al dente, following the packet time. Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining.

2. **Sauté the mushrooms.**  
   While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes until golden and tender. Stir occasionally so they colour evenly without steaming.

3. **Add garlic and cream.**  
   Turn the heat to low. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, just until fragrant. Pour in the double cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Combine with pasta.**  
   Add the drained tagliatelle to the sauce. Toss gently to coat. If it looks too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen it to a silky consistency.

5. **Stir in the cheese.**  
   Add the grated cheese and stir through until melted. Let it rest for a minute or two off the heat so the sauce clings properly to the pasta.

6. **Serve.**  
   Divide between plates and scatter with chopped parsley if using. Add a final grind of black pepper on top.

## Tips

- Use a mix of mushrooms for more flavour and texture  
- Add a splash of white wine before the cream for extra depth  
- A pinch of nutmeg works well stirred into the cream  

## Goes Great With

- Rocket and parmesan salad with lemon dressing  
- Garlic bread or focaccia
