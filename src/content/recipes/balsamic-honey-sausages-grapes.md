## Why You'll Love This

This dish is a tray of contrasts sticky, crisp, jammy, savoury.  
Sausages turn golden and glossy, grapes collapse into sweetness, and the shallots mellow into something you can almost spread.  
It smells like a roast dinner but eats like something you dreamed up with wine in hand.

## Ingredients

- 8 sausages  
- 300g red seedless grapes  
- 6–8 shallots  
- 2 tbsp Fattoria Estense Balsamic Vinegar  
- 1 tbsp runny honey  
- 2 tbsp Centaur Walnut Oil or olive oil  
- 1 tsp Maldon Sea Salt  
- Thyme sprigs (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Heat the oven to 200°C (fan 180°C).**  
   While it warms, place grapes and halved shallots in a large roasting tray. Keep them spread out for better browning.

2. **Whisk up the glaze.**  
   In a small bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, honey, oil, and sea salt. Stir until it looks syrupy and glossy this will coat everything with flavour.

3. **Add sausages and coat.**  
   Tuck the sausages among the grapes and shallots. Pour over the glaze and gently toss everything to get a good coating. Add thyme if using.

4. **Roast for 35–40 minutes.**  
   Turn sausages halfway through. You’re aiming for golden skins, blistered grapes, and shallots soft enough to yield to a spoon.

5. **Serve in the tray, juices and all.**  
   Bring it to the table hot. Dunk bread into those sticky, savoury sweet juices or spoon over mash like it’s gravy with flair.

## Tips

- Figs make a great seasonal swap for grapes add them in the last 10 minutes to avoid mush.  
- For veggie sausages, reduce cooking time by 5–10 minutes and avoid overcrowding the tray.  
- A last minute drizzle of balsamic can brighten the flavours right before serving.

## Goes Great With

- Creamy polenta or mash for a soft, rich base  
- A bitter leaf salad with mustard vinaigrette to cut through the sweetness  
- Crusty sourdough or ciabatta something sturdy enough to swipe up the juices
