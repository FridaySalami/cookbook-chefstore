## Why You'll Love This

It’s the kind of stew that holds you steady.  
A bowl full of warmth and colour, where chickpeas bring their quiet strength, tomatoes soften into tangy comfort, and spinach folds in like an afterthought that makes everything better.

The heat is gentle but certain. The spices don’t shout—they hum.  
Rose harissa adds a little mystery. Garlic does what garlic does. And every bite feels like something that’s doing more than just feeding you.

It’s plant-based, pantry friendly, and forgiving enough to make your own.  
Put the pot on, let it bubble, and trust the house will start to smell like dinner.

## Ingredients

- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  
- 1 Onion  
- 2 Garlic Cloves  
- 1 Teaspoon Smoked Paprika  
- 1/2 to 1 Teaspoon Chilli Flakes  
- 1 Tablespoon Rose Harissa (Optional)  
- 400g Tinned Chopped Tomatoes  
- 400 to 500g Tinned Chickpeas  
- 300ml Vegetable Stock  
- 100g Spinach (Fresh or Frozen)  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  

### Optional Finishes

- Lemon Juice  
- Coconut Cream  
- Chopped Parsley  

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the base**  
   Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and translucent.

2. **Build the flavour**  
   Stir in minced garlic, paprika, chilli flakes, and rose harissa if using. Cook for 1 minute until the kitchen smells like something good is happening.

3. **Add the bulk**  
   Pour in the chopped tomatoes, drained chickpeas, and vegetable stock. Stir well and bring to a simmer.

4. **Simmer low and slow**  
   Let it bubble gently for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken and the flavours will settle into each other.

5. **Add the greens**  
   Stir in the spinach and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until wilted or heated through, depending on whether it's fresh or frozen.

6. **Taste and finish**  
   Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, a swirl of coconut cream, or some chopped herbs if desired.

## Tips

- For extra richness, add a spoon of tahini just before serving.  
- Want it chunkier? Stir in roasted squash or sweet potato cubes.  
- Leftovers thicken overnight and are even better the next day. Just add a splash of water to loosen when reheating.
