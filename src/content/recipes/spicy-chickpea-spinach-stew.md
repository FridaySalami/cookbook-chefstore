## Why You'll Love This

A no-fuss, all-flavour bowl of plant-based comfort.  
Chickpeas bring the bulk, tomatoes the base, spinach the green, and chilli that steady heat you feel in your chest after the third bite.  
It’s healthy-ish, hearty, and hums with spice.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 onion, finely chopped  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- ½–1 tsp chilli flakes (to taste)  
- 1 tbsp Belazu Rose Harissa (optional but recommended)  
- 400g chopped tomatoes (tinned)  
- 400–500g Riverdene Tinned Chickpeas, drained  
- 300ml Essential Cuisine Vegetable Stock  
- 100g spinach (fresh or frozen)  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- Optional: squeeze of lemon, swirl of coconut cream, or chopped parsley  

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large pan. Add onion and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes.
2. Stir in garlic, paprika, chilli flakes, and harissa. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Add tinned tomatoes, chickpeas, and vegetable stock. Stir and bring to a simmer.
4. Simmer gently for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.
5. Stir in spinach and cook until wilted (or heated through, if using frozen).
6. Season to taste. Finish with lemon, coconut cream, or herbs if using.

## Tips

- Add diced sweet potato or butternut squash for extra heartiness.  
- Great over rice, with naan, or spooned into a baked potato.  
- Freezes beautifully—make double, thank yourself later.
