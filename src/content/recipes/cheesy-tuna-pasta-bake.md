## Why You'll Love This

This is a dish that doesn’t try too hard. It just shows up warm, creamy, and familiar — like the dinners you grew up with but never quite wrote down. The kind you throw together on a weeknight and end up craving again by Friday.

The pasta is soft but not soggy. The sauce is thick and coats everything without being too heavy. Tuna brings depth. Sweetcorn brings a little pop of lightness. And the cheese? The cheese bubbles and browns, pulling everything together under a golden lid.

You can stretch it across a few meals. It reheats like a dream. And best of all, it feeds people without fuss. One tray, twenty minutes in the oven, and a whole lot of comfort in every bite.

## Ingredients

- 300g Pasta (Macaroni or Fusilli)  
- 2 Tablespoons Butter  
- 2 Tablespoons Plain Flour  
- 500ml Milk  
- 1 Teaspoon Dijon Mustard  
- ½ Teaspoon Bonferme Fine Sea Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 2 x 145g Tins Tuna in Spring Water  
- 150g Tinned Sweetcorn  
- 100g Grated Cheese (plus extra for topping)  
- Chopped Parsley or Chives (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta.**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 2 minutes less than the packet time. This helps it hold its shape in the oven. Drain and set aside.

2. **Make the sauce.**  
   In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute until smooth and slightly foamy. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until thickened. Stir in the mustard, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.

3. **Combine everything.**  
   Stir the drained tuna and sweetcorn into the sauce. Add the grated cheese and stir until melted. Fold in the cooked pasta until everything is coated and combined.

4. **Transfer and top.**  
   Spoon the mixture into a baking dish. Spread it evenly. Sprinkle over a handful of extra cheese.

5. **Bake.**  
   Place the dish in a 200°C (fan 180°C) oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. It should be bubbling and golden on top.

6. **Rest and serve.**  
   Let the bake sit for 5 minutes before serving. Top with chopped herbs if you’re using them.

## Tips

- Add frozen peas, spinach, or a handful of chopped broccoli for more veg  
- Swap tuna for cooked shredded chicken or smoked mackerel  
- Leftovers can be frozen or stored in the fridge and reheated with a splash of milk

## Goes Great With

- A cucumber salad with dill and lemon  
- Steamed broccoli or green beans  
- Toasted garlic bread or buttered rolls
