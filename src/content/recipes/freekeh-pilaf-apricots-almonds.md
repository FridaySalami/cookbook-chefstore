## Why You'll Love This

This pilaf walks the line between comfort and celebration.  
The freekeh brings smoky depth and a chew that feels grounding. The apricots melt in with just enough sweetness to lift it. The almonds crunch back, and the pomegranate molasses ties it all together with a shimmer of tang.  
It’s balanced, earthy, and quietly bold. Serve it warm, serve it cool, serve it like you made it for someone you care about.

## Ingredients

- 200g Centaur Greenwheat Freekeh, Rinsed  
- 1 Small Onion  
- 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil  
- 600ml Vegetable Stock or Water  
- 8 to 10 Dried Apricots  
- 50g Flaked Almonds  
- 1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin  
- ½ Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 1 Tablespoon Belazu Pomegranate Molasses, Plus Extra To Drizzle  
- Fresh Parsley or Mint, To Garnish

## Instructions

1. **Soften the aromatics**  
   Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent.

2. **Bloom the spices**  
   Stir in the cumin and cinnamon. Let them cook for 30 seconds until the oil smells warm and spiced.

3. **Toast the freekeh**  
   Add the rinsed freekeh to the pan. Stir to coat the grains in oil and toast for 1 to 2 minutes.

4. **Simmer until tender**  
   Pour in the stock or water. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes. The freekeh should be tender with a little bite and the liquid mostly absorbed.

5. **Add the fruit and nuts**  
   Stir in the chopped dried apricots and toasted flaked almonds. Cover and let it sit for 5 minutes off the heat so the flavours can meld.

6. **Season and finish**  
   Add salt, pepper, and the pomegranate molasses. Taste and adjust as needed. Another splash of molasses or grind of pepper can bring it into balance.

7. **Serve with care**  
   Spoon into a wide bowl or platter. Scatter with chopped parsley or mint. Finish with a slow drizzle of pomegranate molasses for shine and sharpness.

## Tips

- Use vegetable stock for a vegan version or swap for chicken stock if preferred  
- Toast the almonds in a dry pan for 2 to 3 minutes until golden for deeper flavour  
- This dish is delicious warm but also makes a great chilled mezze option the next day
