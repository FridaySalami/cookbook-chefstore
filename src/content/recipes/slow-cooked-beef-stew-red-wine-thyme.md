## Why You'll Love This

This is stew the way time intended. A recipe that doesn’t rush. It unfolds slowly—like winter light creeping through curtains, like stories told beside the fire. You start with simple things: onion, carrot, celery. Add beef, browned deep like bark. Wine simmers down. Thyme lifts the pot like memory. And then, just before the end, a quiet whisper of miso. Unexpected, but right.

Serve it on a Sunday when nothing else will do. Or a Tuesday when you need to feel held. It’s humble, but it carries itself with quiet confidence.

## Ingredients

- 600g Stewing Beef, cut into chunks  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 2 Tablespoons Plain Flour  
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  
- 1 Tablespoon Butter  
- 1 Onion  
- 2 Carrots  
- 2 Celery Sticks  
- 3 Garlic Cloves (1 whole, 2 chopped)  
- 75g Pancetta, diced  
- 2 Tablespoons Tomato Paste  
- 300ml Red Wine  
- 500ml Beef Stock  
- 1 Bay Leaf  
- 2 Sprigs Fresh Thyme  
- 1 Strip Orange Zest  
- 1 Star Anise  
- 1 Teaspoon Miso Paste (white or red)  
- 2 Teaspoons Worcestershire Sauce  

## Instructions

### Sear the Beef

1. Pat the beef dry and season generously with salt and pepper. Toss with flour until evenly coated.
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a large heavy pot over high heat. Sear the beef in batches until deeply browned on all sides. Don’t overcrowd. Set aside.

### Build the Base

3. Lower the heat to medium. Add pancetta and cook until golden.
4. Add onion, carrots, celery, and the chopped garlic. Sauté for 10 minutes until softened and catching some colour.
5. Stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 2 minutes to take the edge off its acidity.

### Deglaze and Simmer

6. Pour in the red wine. Let it bubble and reduce by at least half, scraping up all the goodness from the bottom of the pot.
7. Return the beef to the pot along with beef stock, bay leaf, thyme, star anise, orange zest, the whole garlic clove, Worcestershire sauce, and a small pinch of salt.
8. Bring to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook on low heat for 2.5 to 3 hours until the beef is tender and the sauce is thickened.

### Finish with Depth

9. Discard the bay leaf, star anise, and orange zest.
10. Stir in the miso paste. Let it melt in gently, giving body and deep savouriness.
11. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Let rest off the heat for 10 minutes before serving.

## Tips

- Don’t rush the browning—it builds essential flavour.
- A strip of orange zest and a star anise lift this stew into a slightly new place without overpowering the heart of it.
- Leftovers are even better the next day. Reheat gently.
