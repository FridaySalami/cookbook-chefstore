## Why You'll Love This

This is the kinda dish that shows up with no fuss and still steals the show.  
The sauce? Deep and smoky with that floral heat from the rose harissa.  
The chickpeas? Creamy but bold.  
And the eggs? Well, they just float in there like they belong—because they do.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 2 tbsp Belazu Rose Harissa  
- 400g tinned chopped tomatoes (or passata)  
- 400–500g Riverdene tinned chickpeas (drained)  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- 3–4 eggs  
- Fresh parsley or coriander, for garnish  
- Crusty bread or flatbreads, to serve  

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.
2. Add onion and cook for 5–6 minutes until soft and golden. Stir in garlic and cumin; cook 1 minute.
3. Stir in the rose harissa and cook for another minute until fragrant.
4. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, chickpeas, and a splash of water if needed. Season well with salt and pepper.
5. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.
6. Make small wells in the sauce and crack in the eggs.
7. Cover the pan with a lid or foil and cook for 5–7 minutes until the egg whites are set but yolks are still soft.
8. Sprinkle with chopped herbs and serve hot with warm bread.

## Tips

- Add spinach or kale for a leafy boost.  
- Want it creamier? Swirl in a spoon of Greek yoghurt before serving.  
- Make it vegan by skipping the eggs and topping with crispy tofu or avocado.
