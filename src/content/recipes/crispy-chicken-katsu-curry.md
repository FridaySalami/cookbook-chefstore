## Why You'll Love This

It’s crispy, saucy, and comforting in all the best ways.  
The panko chicken brings the crunch, the curry sauce wraps it in warmth, and the rice holds it all steady underneath.  
Tastes like a Friday night favorite but made with your own hands, right in your own kitchen.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 2 Chicken Breasts  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 2 Tablespoons Plain Flour  
- 1 Egg  
- 50g Centaur Panko Breadcrumbs  
- Oil, For Shallow Frying  

### For the Curry Sauce
- 2 to 3 Tablespoons Yutaka Japanese Style Katsu Curry Paste  
- 250ml Water or Chicken Stock  

### To Serve
- Steamed Rice  
- Pickled Vegetables or Shredded Cabbage (Optional)  
- Spring Onions or Sesame Seeds, To Garnish

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the chicken  
Place the chicken breasts between sheets of cling film and gently flatten with a rolling pin. Season both sides with salt and black pepper.  
Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. Place the flour in one, the beaten egg in another, and the panko crumbs in the third.  
Dredge each piece of chicken in flour, then dip in egg, then coat in panko until fully covered.

### 2. Fry the chicken  
Heat 1 to 2 centimeters of oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle a breadcrumb, add the chicken.  
Cook for 3 to 4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.  
Transfer to kitchen paper to drain and rest before slicing.

### 3. Make the sauce  
In a small saucepan, stir the curry paste into the water or stock.  
Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

### 4. Assemble the dish  
Slice the rested chicken into strips. Serve over steamed rice, then pour the warm curry sauce generously over the top.  
Finish with spring onions, sesame seeds, or shredded cabbage for a fresh crunch.

## Tips

- For a vegetarian version, swap the chicken for firm tofu or roasted sweet potato slices  
- Add Japanese pickles or a simple slaw on the side to balance the richness  
- Leftover curry sauce keeps well in the fridge or freezer for a speedy lunch

## Goes Great With

- Fluffy jasmine or sticky rice  
- A cold beer or iced green tea  
- Weeknights that need a bit of gold and crunch
