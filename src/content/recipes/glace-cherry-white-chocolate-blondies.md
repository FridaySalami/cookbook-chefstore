## Why You'll Love This

Sweet glacé cherries. Creamy white chocolate. A fudgy, golden blondie base that walks the line between soft and chewy.  
These feel like something from a childhood bake sale but with just enough grown-up flourish to bring them proudly to a dinner party.  
They’re simple, nostalgic, and exactly the kind of thing that disappears before the kettle’s even boiled.

## Ingredients

- 170g Unsalted Butter, Melted  
- 220g Light Brown Sugar  
- 2 Large Eggs  
- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract  
- ½ Teaspoon Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract  
- 200g Plain Flour  
- 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder  
- Pinch of Salt  
- 100g Glace Cherries, Halved  
- 150g Callebaut White Chocolate Callets

## Instructions

1. **Prepare your tin**  
   Preheat the oven to 180°C or 160°C fan. Line a 20cm square tin with parchment, leaving some overhang for easy lifting later.

2. **Blend the butter and sugar**  
   In a mixing bowl, stir together the melted butter and brown sugar until it looks glossy and rich like warm caramel.

3. **Add the eggs and extracts**  
   Whisk in the eggs one at a time. Then stir through the vanilla and almond extract until smooth and thick.

4. **Mix the dry ingredients**  
   In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add this to the wet mixture and fold gently until just combined. Don’t overmix or you’ll lose the fudgy texture.

5. **Add the fun stuff**  
   Toss the halved cherries in a little flour (this stops them sinking). Fold them into the batter with the white chocolate callets.

6. **Spread and smooth**  
   Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. It doesn’t have to look perfect—it’ll settle as it bakes.

7. **Bake to perfection**  
   Bake for 22 to 25 minutes. You’re looking for golden edges and a centre that’s just set. A skewer should come out with moist crumbs, not raw batter.

8. **Cool and slice**  
   Let cool completely in the tin. Lift out using the parchment and slice into squares.

## Tips

- Scatter flaked almonds on top before baking for extra crunch and almond depth  
- Swap cherries for dried cranberries or chopped apricots if you fancy a twist  
- These freeze well wrap individually and freeze for up to 2 months
