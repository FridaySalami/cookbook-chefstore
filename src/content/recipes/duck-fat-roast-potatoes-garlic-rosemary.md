## Why You'll Love This

A roast potato done right is a kind of devotion.  
Crisp edges that shatter under a fork. Golden crust giving way to soft, fluffy middles.  
When they’re roasted in duck fat, kissed with garlic and rosemary, you’re not just making a side. You’re delivering a memory. The kind people ask about on the drive home.

## Ingredients

- 1kg Floury Potatoes (Maris Piper or King Edward)  
- 2 to 3 Tablespoons Centaur Duck Fat  
- 1 Head Garlic, Cloves Peeled But Left Whole  
- A Few Sprigs Fresh Rosemary  
- Maldon Sea Salt, To Taste  
- Tidman’s Rock Salt (Optional), To Finish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the potatoes**  
   Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky, even pieces. Rinse under cold water to remove excess starch.  
   Boil in salted water for 8 to 10 minutes until just tender. You want the outsides soft but the insides still firm.  
   Drain well, then return to the pot and shake gently to roughen the edges. This helps build that legendary crisp.

2. **Heat the fat**  
   Preheat your oven to 200°C fan.  
   Place the duck fat into a large roasting tray and put it in the oven for 5 minutes until the fat is hot and shimmering.

3. **Roast the potatoes**  
   Carefully add the potatoes to the hot fat. They should sizzle on contact.  
   Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Toss everything gently to coat.  
   Roast for 45 to 50 minutes, turning once or twice, until the potatoes are golden, crisp, and deeply tempting.

4. **Finish and serve**  
   Remove the tray from the oven. Let the potatoes rest briefly on kitchen paper if needed.  
   Sprinkle generously with Maldon sea salt and, if you like extra crunch, a touch of Tidman’s rock salt.  
   Serve hot and expect silence around the table.

## Tips

- Don’t overcrowd the tray — space means crisp, steam means soft  
- A drizzle of Belazu Lemon Oil at the end brings a bright citrus note that lifts everything  
- Leftovers reheat beautifully or can be smashed in a skillet for crispy breakfast potatoes

## Goes Great With

- Roast chicken, lamb, or nut roast  
- Yorkshire puddings and proper gravy  
- A chilled cider or sparkling white wine
