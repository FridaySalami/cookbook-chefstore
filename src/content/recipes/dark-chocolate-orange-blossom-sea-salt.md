## Why You'll Love This

Rich, velvety, and just a little mysterious.  
These pots are small but deep, like conversations after midnight.  
The dark chocolate is smooth and confident. The orange blossom is floral and fleeting. And the sea salt? That’s the detail you didn’t know you needed.  
It’s a dessert that doesn’t shout. It whispers. And it lingers.

## Ingredients

- 150g Dark Chocolate (70 Percent), Chopped  
- 250ml Double Cream  
- 1 Tablespoon Nielsen-Massey Orange Blossom Water  
- 1 Tablespoon Sugar (Optional, To Taste)  
- Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, To Finish

## Instructions

1. **Heat the cream**  
   Pour the cream into a small saucepan and place over low heat. Warm gently until it begins to steam around the edges but do not let it boil.

2. **Add the chocolate**  
   Remove the pan from heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for a full minute to begin melting in the warmth.

3. **Stir slowly**  
   Using a spoon or spatula, stir the mixture until smooth and glossy. Add the orange blossom water and stir again. Taste and add sugar if you want a slightly softer finish.

4. **Divide and chill**  
   Pour the chocolate mixture into ramekins, espresso cups, or small glasses. Let them cool slightly at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours until set with a gentle wobble.

5. **Finish and serve**  
   Just before serving, sprinkle each pot with a few flakes of Maldon sea salt. Keep it delicate. A little goes a long way.

## Tips

- These are rich, so small portions really do go the distance  
- For added depth, stir in a splash of coffee liqueur or a drop of almond extract  
- Garnish with candied orange peel, crushed pistachios, or dark chocolate shards  
- Serve with a crisp biscuit or a spoonful of crème fraîche to cut through the richness

## Goes Great With

- A glass of tawny port, sweet sherry, or strong espresso  
- A short silence between friends who don’t need to fill the air  
- The feeling of something simple done beautifully
