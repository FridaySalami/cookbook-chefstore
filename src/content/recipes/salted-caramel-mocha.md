## Why You'll Love This

This is more than just a coffee.  
It’s the kind of drink that meets you where you are curled up on the sofa, hunched over your laptop, or catching your breath in the quiet after a long day.

Sweet and salty in perfect balance, it hugs the tongue with rich chocolate and finishes with a little cream cloud on top.  
You don’t need a café. You don’t need a queue.  
Just a mug, a minute, and a reason to pause.

The best part? You can tailor every sip. Make it bold, light, extra whipped, dairy free, spiked, or spiced.  
However you serve it, it feels like a small luxury. And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.

## Ingredients

- 100ml Strong Brewed Coffee or 2 Shots Espresso  
- 2 Tablespoons Salted Caramel Syrup  
- 1 Tablespoon Chocolate Syrup or White Chocolate Sauce  
- 250ml Milk  
- Whipped Cream (Optional)  
- Flaky Sea Salt (Optional)  

## Instructions

1. **Brew the coffee**  
   Make your espresso or strong brewed coffee and pour it into a small saucepan or heatproof jug while hot.

2. **Add the syrups**  
   Stir in the salted caramel and chocolate syrup. Let them melt into the coffee, turning it smooth and fragrant.

3. **Warm the milk**  
   Heat the milk in a small pan or using a milk frother until steamy but not boiling. If you like foam, whisk or froth to your heart’s content.

4. **Bring it together**  
   Pour the flavoured coffee into your favourite mug. Top with the hot milk and stir gently to combine.

5. **Top and finish**  
   Spoon whipped cream over the top if using. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt for a little sparkle. Sip slow and savour.

## Tips

- To make it iced, let the coffee cool completely. Shake all the ingredients with ice and pour over chilled milk.  
- Try swapping the syrups—use Toffee Nut, Cinnamon, or Pumpkin Spice for seasonal spins.  
- Add a splash of Irish cream liqueur or bourbon for a grown-up version worth staying in for.

## Goes Great With

- A soft blanket and a storm outside  
- Chocolate cookies or shortbread on the side  
- A slow morning that doesn’t need to start just yet
