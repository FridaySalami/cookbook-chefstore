## Why You'll Love This

This is the kind of dish that catches you off guard with how much joy it holds.  
Kimchi fried rice isn’t trying to be fancy, but it hits every craving at once.  
You’ve got heat and tang and umami—plus that deep soul satisfaction of transforming yesterday’s rice into something that feels like a celebration.

It’s a dish built on humble leftovers but feels bold and deliberate.  
When the garlic hits the hot oil, the kitchen smells alive.  
When the rice starts to crisp, you’ll want to lean in and watch.  
And when that fried egg lands on top, yolk ready to run, everything just... makes sense.

It’s comfort food, but not quiet. It’s sharp and sizzling and totally unapologetic.  
And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.

## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp Sesame Oil  
- 1 Tbsp Neutral Oil (Sunflower or Vegetable)  
- 2 Garlic Cloves  
- 150g Kimchi  
- 250g Cooked Rice  
- 1 Tbsp Dark Soy Sauce  
- 1 Tsp Gochujang (Optional)  
- 2 Eggs  
- Spring Onions  
- Sesame Seeds  
- Optional: Nori Flakes, Toasted Peanuts, Sriracha

## Instructions

1. **Start with the sizzle**  
   Heat the sesame oil and neutral oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Let it get hot enough that a tiny piece of garlic would dance.

2. **Wake the garlic**  
   Add the garlic, minced fine. Stir it gently for 30 seconds until fragrant. It should smell sweet and sharp, not burnt. If it browns, the heat’s too high—turn it down.

3. **Cook the kimchi down**  
   Add the chopped kimchi. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until it softens and caramelises a little. This tames its bite and brings out the sweetness hidden inside.

4. **Add the rice**  
   Tip in the cold rice. Use a spatula to break it apart and toss it with the kimchi. Press it gently into the pan every so often to crisp the edges. Stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes until it’s steaming hot with golden flecks.

5. **Season with soy and spice**  
   Pour in the soy sauce. If using gochujang, stir that in too. Toss everything until the rice is evenly coated and just glossy enough to catch the light.

6. **Fry the eggs**  
   In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. You want that golden spill to soak into the rice later.

7. **Assemble and finish**  
   Divide the rice between bowls. Slide a fried egg on top of each. Scatter with sliced spring onions, sesame seeds, and any extras you like—nori, peanuts, or a sharp drizzle of sriracha.

## Tips

- Cold rice is your best friend here. Freshly cooked rice turns mushy. Let it chill in the fridge for at least a few hours first.
- Use up what you have. Leftover roast meat, a few mushrooms, or cubes of tofu all work brilliantly stirred in before the egg.
- For a vegan version, skip the egg and top with avocado slices or pan-fried tofu. Add a splash of lime for contrast.

## Goes Great With

- Pickled cucumber or daikon for crunch and contrast  
- A small bowl of miso soup or broth to sip between bites  
- A quiet evening that needs waking up with spice
