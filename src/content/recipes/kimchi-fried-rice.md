## Why You'll Love This

This rice is comfort food with a kick.  
Sour, spicy kimchi gets cooked down till mellow and sweet, rice goes crispy round the edges, and a fried egg slides over the top like a crown.  
Fast, fiery, and straight-up addictive.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp sesame oil  
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (like sunflower or vegetable)  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 150g Biona Organic Kimchi, roughly chopped  
- 250g cooked, cold rice (jasmine or short grain ideal)  
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce  
- 1 tsp gochujang (optional, for extra heat)  
- 2 eggs  
- Spring onions, sliced, for garnish  
- Sesame seeds, for garnish  
- Optional: nori flakes, toasted peanuts, or a drizzle of sriracha  

## Instructions

1. Heat sesame oil and neutral oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Stir in chopped kimchi. Cook for 2–3 minutes until slightly caramelised and reduced.
4. Add rice and break it up with a spatula. Stir-fry for 5–6 minutes until heated through and lightly crispy.
5. Stir in soy sauce and gochujang if using. Toss to coat evenly.
6. In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up until whites are set and yolks are runny.
7. Plate the rice, top with fried eggs, and garnish with spring onions, sesame seeds, and extras if desired.

## Tips

- Use **day-old rice** for best texture—it fries better than freshly cooked rice.
- Add chopped bacon, tofu, or leftover roast meats if you like.
- Want it vegan? Skip the egg and top with avocado or crispy tofu cubes.
