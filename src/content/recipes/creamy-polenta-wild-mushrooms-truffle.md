## Why You'll Love This

It’s the kind of meal that quiets things down.  
The polenta is soft like memory, the mushrooms soak up every bit of garlic and thyme, and that last swirl of truffle oil makes you close your eyes for a second.  
Perfect for when you want something that feels both simple and special.

## Ingredients

- 100g Merchant Gourmet Polenta  
- 600ml Water or Mushroom Stock (Essential Cuisine recommended)  
- 25g Butter  
- 50g Parmesan (Optional)  
- 20g Dried Mixed Mushrooms or Porcini  
- 1 Garlic Clove  
- 1 Teaspoon Fresh Thyme Leaves  
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil or Butter  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- Belazu Black Truffle Extra Virgin Olive Oil, To Finish

## Instructions

1. **Soak the mushrooms**  
   Place the dried mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes. Once softened, drain and gently squeeze out excess moisture. Roughly chop if any pieces are large.

2. **Start the polenta**  
   In a saucepan, bring the water or stock to a gentle boil. Gradually pour in the polenta while whisking. Lower the heat and stir often until thick and creamy. This takes 5 to 7 minutes with quick-cook polenta, longer with traditional.

3. **Enrich the base**  
   Stir in the butter and Parmesan if using. Season with salt and black pepper. Keep warm on low heat while you finish the mushrooms.

4. **Cook the mushrooms**  
   Heat olive oil or butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for a minute until fragrant. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes until golden and slightly crisp at the edges.

5. **Bring it together**  
   Spoon the polenta into bowls. Top with the warm mushrooms and a drizzle of Belazu Truffle Oil. Finish with extra Parmesan or a touch of flaky salt if you like.

## Tips

- Stir in a splash of cream to the polenta for extra richness  
- A poached or fried egg on top turns this into a dreamy brunch or comfort dinner  
- If using mushroom stock concentrate or glace, add a spoonful while cooking the mushrooms for more depth

## Goes Great With

- A peppery rocket salad with lemon dressing  
- Crusty bread to catch every bit of sauce  
- A dry red or a cold glass of white Burgundy and a quiet moment
