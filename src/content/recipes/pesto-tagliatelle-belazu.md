## Why You'll Love This

Sometimes dinner doesn’t need to be loud to be good.  
This is quiet luxury in a bowl—ribbons of warm tagliatelle, coated in a pesto that hums with basil, cheese, and a touch of garlic. No need to chop, no need to fuss. Just pasta, pesto, and a few minutes of gentle stirring.

It’s the kind of meal that catches you off guard with how good it is.  
You might stand over the stove tasting spoon after spoon before it even hits the plate.  
It’s quick enough for a tired Tuesday but comforting enough for when you want to feel looked after.  
One pot. One bowl. One very content sigh.

## Ingredients

- 250g Tagliatelle  
- 2 Heaped Tablespoons Pesto Genovese  
- 2 Tablespoons Reserved Pasta Water  
- Grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano  
- Black Pepper  
- Optional: Olive Oil or Rocket Leaves  

## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook until tender with a little bite, usually 8 to 9 minutes.

2. **Prep the pesto**  
   While the pasta cooks, place the pesto in a large bowl—one big enough to toss the pasta in later. Let it come to room temperature while you wait.

3. **Reserve the water**  
   Just before draining, scoop out a small cup of the pasta water. This starchy liquid will help the pesto cling and gloss every strand.

4. **Combine**  
   Drain the pasta and add it straight into the bowl with the pesto. Pour in a splash of the pasta water and gently stir or toss until the pesto melts into a silky sauce. If it looks too thick, add a little more water. If too thin, let it sit for a minute to thicken.

5. **Taste and serve**  
   Finish with grated cheese and a crack of black pepper. If you like, drizzle over a little olive oil or scatter rocket on top for a fresh lift.

## Tips

- Use the heat of the pasta to warm the pesto gently—no need to cook it.  
- Lemon zest or a spoonful of ricotta adds brightness and richness.  
- Make it heartier with grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, or pan-fried mushrooms.
