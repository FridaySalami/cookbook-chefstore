## Why You'll Love This

These noodles are a full-body nod.  
Quick to make, packed with umami, and just the right kind of messy.  
Serve ‘em straight or toss in extras—leftover chicken, crispy tofu, or a fried egg on top.

## Ingredients

- 200g wheat noodles or spaghetti  
- 2 tbsp dark soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp honey or brown sugar  
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar or lime juice  
- 1 tsp sesame oil  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp ginger, grated  
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (like sunflower or vegetable)  
- Optional toppings: spring onions, sesame seeds, chilli flakes  

## Instructions

1. Cook noodles according to packet instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a bowl, mix both soy sauces, honey, vinegar, and sesame oil.
3. Heat oil in a wok or frying pan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger. Sizzle gently for 30 seconds.
4. Pour in the sauce mix. Let it bubble and thicken slightly—about 1 minute.
5. Add the cooked noodles. Toss and stir until they’re glossy and coated in sticky sauce.
6. Serve hot, topped with spring onions, sesame seeds, and chilli flakes if you fancy a kick.

## Tips

- Want it spicy? Add a spoon of chilli crisp or fresh chopped red chilli.
- Leftover roast veg or shredded chicken can jump in here with no fuss.
- Gluten-free? Use tamari and rice noodles.
