## Why You'll Love This

There’s something about a pot gently bubbling on the hob that settles a house.  
This isn’t just soup it’s a reset button.  
Pearl barley gives it weight. Chicken adds calm. And that broth? It carries stories your body remembers even if your mind’s too tired.

For quiet days. Cold nights. Or when you just need something to *hold you up a bit*.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  
- 1 Onion  
- 2 Carrots  
- 2 Sticks Celery  
- 1 Leek  
- 2 Garlic Cloves  
- 1.2 Litres Hot Water  
- 1 Heaped Tbsp Knorr Chicken Bouillon Jelly  
- 150g Triple Lion Pearl Barley  
- 300g Cooked Chicken  
- 1 Bay Leaf  
- 2 Sprigs Fresh Thyme (or ½ tsp Dried Thyme)  
- Juice of Half a Lemon  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper

## Instructions

1. **Start slow.**  
   Heat the oil in a big pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and leek.  
   Let them soften gently about 8–10 minutes until they start to lose their edges and smell like the start of something healing.

2. **Build the flavour.**  
   Stir in the garlic and let it warm for a minute. Pour in the hot water, then stir in the bouillon. It should melt into gold—rich, savoury, and honest.

3. **Let the barley bloom.**  
   Add the rinsed pearl barley, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring everything to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer quietly.  
   Cover and leave it for around 45 minutes, checking in now and then as the barley softens and the broth thickens like it’s remembering something.

4. **Bring it together.**  
   Stir in the chicken and let it warm through for another 10–15 minutes.  
   Take out the bay leaf. Breathe it in. You’re nearly there.

5. **Finish and balance.**  
   Squeeze in the lemon juice. Season with salt and a good crack of pepper.  
   Taste. Adjust. Taste again if you feel like it. This bit is for you.

## Tips

- Make it ahead. Like all good broths, this one deepens overnight. It reheats like a dream just loosen with a splash of water.
- A knob of butter stirred in at the end adds richness and rounds out the sharp lemon.
- Want it veggie? Knorr Vegetable Bouillon + butter beans or mushrooms = just as lovely.

## Goes Great With

- Warm, crusty sourdough with plenty of butter  
- A melted cheese toastie on the side  
- Quiet nights, deep breaths, and nowhere to be
