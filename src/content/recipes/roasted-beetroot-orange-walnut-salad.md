## Why You'll Love This

This is a salad that knows how to dress up.  
It brings roasted beetroot—deep, sweet, and jewel-toned—into the same space as citrus-bright orange and buttery walnuts. Each bite is a little contrast. A little harmony.

The rocket gives it that peppery lift, like it’s reminding you this is still a salad.  
But then comes the truffle oil, and suddenly everything softens. The dish leans into elegance. Into something you’d serve with linen napkins and a second glass of wine.

It’s earthy and vibrant. Classic but not boring.  
Whether you serve it warm or chilled, on a weekday or a long-table Sunday lunch, it shows up with confidence.

## Ingredients

- 3 Medium Beetroots  
- 2 Oranges  
- 75g Walnut Pieces  
- 2 Handfuls Rocket or Baby Spinach  
- 1 Tablespoon Truffle Oil  
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  
- 1 Teaspoon Honey  
- Sea Salt  
- Black Pepper  

## Instructions

1. **Roast the beetroot**  
   Preheat your oven to 200°C. Peel the beetroot and cut into wedges. Toss with olive oil, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Spread out on a baking tray and roast for 40 to 45 minutes, flipping once, until tender and caramelised at the edges.

2. **Toast the walnuts**  
   While the beetroot roasts, add the walnut pieces to a dry frying pan over medium heat. Toast for 2 to 3 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden. Set aside to cool.

3. **Segment and juice the oranges**  
   Cut the peel and white pith off one orange, then segment by slicing between the membranes. Juice the second orange into a small bowl.

4. **Make the dressing**  
   Add honey, a pinch of salt, and the truffle oil to the orange juice. Whisk gently until it comes together into a glossy dressing.

5. **Assemble the salad**  
   Lay the rocket or spinach on a large serving platter. Scatter over the roasted beetroot, orange segments, and toasted walnuts.

6. **Dress and finish**  
   Drizzle with the citrus-truffle dressing. Add a final flick of truffle oil over the top if you want more depth. Serve immediately.

## Tips

- Add thinly sliced red onion for sharpness or crumbled goat cheese for creaminess.  
- No truffle oil? Use a fruity olive oil and top with shaved Parmesan.  
- The beetroot can be roasted in advance and served cold the next day for an easy make-ahead option.
