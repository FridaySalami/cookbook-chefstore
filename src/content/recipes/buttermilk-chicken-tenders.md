## Why You'll Love This

These tenders are the golden kind crisp on the outside, juicy in the middle, and made for dunking.  
The buttermilk makes them tender as anything, while the crumbs deliver the crunch.  
And that honey mustard dip? Tangy, sweet, and a little bit addictive.

## Ingredients

### Chicken Tenders

- 500g chicken breast or mini fillets  
- 250ml buttermilk  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- salt  
- pepper  
- 100g plain flour  
- 100g breadcrumbs or panko  
- oil for shallow frying or olive oil spray  

### Honey Mustard Dip

- 3 tbsp Centaur Dijon Mustard  
- 2 tbsp Hyve Squeezy Honey  
- 1 tbsp mayonnaise or Greek yoghurt  
- 1 tsp lemon juice (optional)

## Instructions

### 1. Marinate the Chicken

1. Cut chicken into strips if using breasts.
2. In a bowl, mix buttermilk, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper.
3. Add chicken and marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the fridge.

### 2. Coat the Chicken

1. Mix flour and breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl.
2. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess, then coat in crumb mix.
3. For extra crispiness, double-dip: back into buttermilk, then back into crumbs.

### 3. Cook the Chicken

#### 🧑‍🍳 Oven Method
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan). Line a tray with baking paper.
2. Spray tenders with oil and bake for 18–22 minutes, turning once, until golden and cooked through.

#### 🍳 Shallow Fry Method
1. Heat 1–2cm of oil in a pan over medium heat.
2. Fry tenders in batches for 3–4 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.
3. Drain on kitchen paper.

### 4. Make the Dip

1. In a small bowl, whisk mustard, honey, and mayo/yoghurt until smooth.
2. Add lemon juice to brighten it up, if you like.

## Tips

- Freeze breaded but uncooked tenders for a fast dinner later—bake from frozen at 200°C for 25–30 mins.
- Use wholegrain mustard or yellow mustard for a milder dip.
- Add cayenne to the crumb mix if you're craving a kick.

## Goes Great With

- Fries or sweet potato wedges  
- Crisp slaw or tangy pickles  
- A no-fuss movie night or party platter spread
