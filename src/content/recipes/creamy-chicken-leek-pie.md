## Why You'll Love This

There’s something deeply comforting about a pie like this. A golden, puffed-up lid hiding a soft and savoury filling beneath. It’s warm and familiar, but still feels like something special.  

The chicken is tender. The leeks melt into the sauce. The cream and mustard pull it all together in a way that’s rich but never heavy. The wine brings a quiet brightness, and the pastry? It’s the kind of flake that makes you close your eyes for a second.

This pie doesn’t ask for a celebration — it becomes one. The kind of dinner that slows the room down a little, makes people linger just a few bites longer, and fills more than just the plate.

## Ingredients

- 500g Diced Chicken Thigh or Breast  
- 2 Leeks  
- 2 Garlic Cloves  
- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  
- 25g Butter  
- 1 Tablespoon Heygates Plain Flour  
- 150ml White Wine  
- 200ml Kerrymaid Double Cream  
- 1 Teaspoon Maldon Sea Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- 1 Teaspoon Centaur Dijon Mustard  
- 320g Puff Pastry Sheet  
- 1 Egg (for brushing)

## Instructions

1. **Start the base.**  
   Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes until soft. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.

2. **Brown the chicken.**  
   Add the diced chicken to the pan. Stir regularly and cook for 5 to 7 minutes until just coloured. It does not need to be fully cooked at this stage.

3. **Build the sauce.**  
   Stir in the flour and let it cook for 1 minute, coating the chicken and leeks. Pour in the white wine and let it bubble for 2 minutes to reduce slightly.

4. **Add cream and mustard.**  
   Stir in the cream and Dijon mustard. Season with Maldon sea salt and plenty of black pepper. Let the mixture simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before assembling.

5. **Assemble the pie.**  
   Spoon the filling into a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and lay it over the top. Trim any overhang, press the edges to seal, and cut a small steam hole in the centre.

6. **Bake until golden.**  
   Brush the top with beaten egg. Bake in a 200°C (fan 180°C) oven for 25 to 30 minutes or until the pastry is deep golden and puffed.

7. **Let it rest.**  
   Allow the pie to sit for 5 minutes before serving. The filling will settle and become easier to portion.

## Tips

- Use cooked leftover chicken and skip the browning step to save time  
- Stir in a handful of peas or chopped spinach before baking for a touch of green  
- A teaspoon of tarragon or thyme adds lovely herbal depth

## Goes Great With

- Steamed broccoli or green beans  
- Mashed potatoes or a light green salad  
- A spoonful of apple chutney or sharp pickle on the side
