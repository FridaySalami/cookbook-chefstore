## Why You'll Love This

You ever bite into something and just stop for a second?  
That perfect *crunch* gives way to juicy chicken, light and golden on the outside, tender and seasoned within.  
These bites are made for dipping, stacking, or straight-up stealing off the tray before anyone notices.  
Simple, crispy, and addictive in the best way.

## Ingredients

- 2 Chicken Breasts, Cut Into Bite-Sized Pieces  
- 1 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs  
- ½ Cup Plain Flour  
- 2 Large Eggs  
- 1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder  
- ½ Teaspoon Paprika  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- Vegetable Oil, For Frying  

### Optional Dips
- Sweet Chili Sauce  
- Honey Mustard  
- Barbecue Sauce  
- Garlic Mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. **Set up your coating station**  
   Place the flour in one shallow bowl. Beat the eggs in a second bowl. In a third, combine the panko breadcrumbs with garlic powder, paprika, a pinch of salt, and black pepper.

2. **Coat the chicken**  
   Dip each piece of chicken into the flour, then the egg, then the seasoned panko. Press gently to help the coating stick.

3. **Heat the oil**  
   Pour vegetable oil into a deep pan to a depth of about 2 inches. Heat to 180°C or 350°F. The oil should sizzle gently when a breadcrumb is dropped in.

4. **Fry the chicken**  
   Fry the chicken pieces in batches for 2 to 3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the pan.

5. **Rest and drain**  
   Transfer cooked chicken to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Let rest a few minutes while you prep your dips.

6. **Serve and enjoy**  
   Pile onto a platter and serve hot with your choice of dipping sauces.

## Tips

- For even more crunch, double dip: egg, panko, egg again, and another layer of panko  
- Want to bake instead of fry? Lightly oil the breaded bites and bake at 200°C for 20 minutes, flipping halfway  
- You can freeze them after breading for a quick fry-up anytime

## Goes Great With

- Crispy fries or oven-roasted wedges  
- Tucked into wraps with shredded lettuce and garlic sauce  
- Game nights, lunchboxes, or impromptu kitchen picnics
