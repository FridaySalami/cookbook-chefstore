## Why You'll Love This

These are the kind of bakes that feel like home.  
Sticky and sweet from golden syrup, with bursts of fruit in every bite. They’re chewy where it counts, golden around the edges, and just the right kind of nostalgic.  
Perfect with a hot cuppa or tucked into a lunchbox for later. And maybe even better the next day—if they last that long.

## Ingredients

- 250g Porridge Oats  
- 125g Unsalted Butter  
- 125g Tate & Lyle Squeezy Golden Syrup  
- 100g Buchanan Sultanas  
- 75g Glace Cherries, Halved  
- 50g Light Brown Sugar  
- Pinch of Salt

## Instructions

1. **Preheat and prep**  
   Preheat the oven to 160°C fan. Line a 20cm square baking tin with parchment paper.

2. **Melt the base**  
   In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, golden syrup, and sugar together. Stir gently until smooth and combined.

3. **Mix in the dry ingredients**  
   Remove from the heat. Stir in the oats, salt, sultanas, and cherries. Mix until all the oats are glossy and the fruit is evenly distributed.

4. **Fill the tin**  
   Spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Press it down firmly with the back of a spoon to level and compact the surface.

5. **Bake**  
   Bake for 22 to 25 minutes until golden around the edges and lightly set in the centre.

6. **Cool and slice**  
   Let the flapjacks cool completely in the tin. Once firm, lift out and cut into bars or squares.

## Tips

- Add dried apricots, cranberries, or mixed seeds for more texture  
- For chewier flapjacks, bake for the shorter time and cool fully before slicing  
- Store in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze in portions for grab-and-go snacking

## Goes Great With

- A Mug of Strong Tea or Fresh Coffee  
- Packed Lunches or Picnic Hampers  
- A Light Drizzle of Melted Dark Chocolate on Top (Highly Recommended)
