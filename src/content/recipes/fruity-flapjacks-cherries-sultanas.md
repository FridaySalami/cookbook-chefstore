## Why You'll Love This

Sticky. Buttery. Fruity.  
This is the kind of bake that sticks to your fingers and your memory. A proper teatime traybake with oats, sweet fruit, and a golden syrup glaze that caramelises just right.

## Ingredients

- 250g porridge oats  
- 125g unsalted butter  
- 125g Tate & Lyle Squeezy Golden Syrup  
- 100g Buchanan Sultanas  
- 75g Glace Cherries, halved  
- 50g light brown sugar  
- Pinch of salt  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 160°C (fan). Line a 20cm square baking tin with parchment.
2. In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, golden syrup, and sugar until smooth.
3. Stir in the oats, salt, sultanas, and cherries until everything is coated.
4. Press mixture firmly into the tin and smooth the top.
5. Bake for 22–25 minutes until golden at the edges.
6. Cool completely in the tin, then cut into bars or squares.

## Tips

- Add chopped apricots, mixed peel, or seeds for extra texture.  
- For extra chewy texture, slightly underbake and let firm up as it cools.  
- Store airtight for up to a week—or freeze in slices.

## Goes Great With

- A strong cup of tea  
- Packed lunches or hiking snacks  
- A drizzle of dark chocolate (optional but excellent)
