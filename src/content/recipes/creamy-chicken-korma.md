## Why You'll Love This

Smooth as a Southern sunset and full of spice like a backroad preacher’s sermon.  
This korma ain’t shoutin’—it’s **seducin’**.  
Mild enough for the kids, rich enough to feel fancy, and easy enough for a Tuesday.

## Ingredients

### Protein & Dairy
- 500g chicken breast, diced  
- 100–150g plain yoghurt (room temp)  
- 100ml double cream  

### Base
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 2 tbsp oil or ghee  
- 1 tsp garlic paste  
- 1 tsp ginger paste  
- 1 tbsp tomato purée  

### Spices (ground)
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- ½ tsp ground turmeric  
- ½ tsp garam masala  
- ½ tsp paprika or mild curry powder  
- Salt to taste  

### Whole Spices (optional but boss-tier)
- 1 small cinnamon stick  
- 2 cardamom pods (lightly crushed)  
- 1 clove  

### Sweet/Nut Layer
- 2 tbsp ground almonds  
- 1 tsp sugar (adjust to taste)  
- 25g creamed coconut (about ⅛ block), chopped  

### Liquids
- 1 x 400ml can coconut milk  
- Splash of hot water if too thick  

### Optional Flourish
- ¼ tsp rose water or kewra water  
- Toasted almonds & chopped coriander to serve  

## Instructions

1. In a deep pan, heat oil or ghee. Sauté the chopped onion until golden.
2. Add garlic and ginger paste. Fry for a minute, then stir in tomato purée and dry ground spices. Let it sizzle.
3. Add whole spices and toast them gently until fragrant—they’ll stay in the dish till the end for full flavor. You can fish them out before serving.
4. Stir in the chicken. Cook until sealed on all sides.
5. Pour in coconut milk, ground almonds, sugar, and creamed coconut. Stir well.
6. Add a splash of hot water if needed. Cover and cook for 20 minutes on low heat, until chicken is tender and sauce is rich.
7. Now gently stir in the yoghurt and heat through, taking care not to boil.
8. Finish with the double cream and a dash of rose/kewra water if using.
9. Remove whole spices if desired, and serve garnished with toasted almonds and chopped coriander.

## Tips

- For deeper flavor, marinate the chicken in yoghurt and spices for 30 mins first.
- Go vegetarian by swappin’ the chicken with paneer or chickpeas.
- Store leftovers—this curry sings even louder the next day.
