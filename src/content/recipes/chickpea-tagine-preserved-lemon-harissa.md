## Why You'll Love This

This isn’t a “what’s in the cupboard” kind of meal. This is slow brewed comfort wrapped in spice and story.  
The preserved lemon gives it edge, the harissa brings the fire, and the chickpeas hold it all steady like old friends.  
It’s deep and rich, but easy enough for a weekday. And when it hits the table? Everything just softens.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  
- 1 Onion  
- 3 Garlic Cloves  
- 1 Tbsp Belazu Rose Harissa  
- 1 Tsp Ground Cumin  
- 1 Tsp Smoked Paprika  
- 1 Cinnamon Stick (or ½ Tsp Ground Cinnamon)  
- 400g Canned Chopped Tomatoes  
- 2 × 400g Cans Chickpeas (Riverdene), Drained  
- 400ml Vegetable Stock (Made with Knorr Vegetable Bouillon)  
- ½ Preserved Lemon (Belazu), Finely Chopped  
- Salt  
- Black Pepper  
- Fresh Coriander or Parsley, To Serve  
- Cooked Couscous or Flatbreads, To Serve

## Instructions

1. **Soften the base.**  
   Heat the olive oil in a wide pan or tagine over medium heat. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened and golden at the edges. Stir in the garlic and let it bloom for a minute.

2. **Add the spice.**  
   Stir in the rose harissa, cumin, paprika, and cinnamon. Cook for a few minutes until it all smells warm and vivid like something halfway between comfort and celebration.

3. **Bring in the tomatoes.**  
   Pour in the chopped tomatoes and let them cook down for 5–7 minutes, reducing and darkening until thick and jammy at the bottom of the pot.

4. **Chickpeas, stock, and lemon.**  
   Tip in the drained chickpeas, pour over the vegetable stock, and stir in the finely chopped preserved lemon. Bring to a gentle boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. You’re looking for a stew like texture saucy, thick, but loose enough to spoon.

5. **Taste and finish.**  
   Check for seasoning add salt and a crack of black pepper to taste. Just before serving, scatter with chopped fresh herbs. Serve hot over couscous or with warm flatbreads for scooping.


## Tips

- Want it richer? Swirl in a spoonful of tahini at the end, or a dollop of yoghurt if not keeping it vegan.  
- Add chopped green olives or dried apricots in the final 10 minutes for extra tang or sweetness.  
- Leftovers deepen overnight this one’s even better the next day with a reheated swirl of lemony olive oil.

## Goes Great With

- Fluffy couscous or warm flatbreads  
- Roasted aubergine or charred courgettes on the side  
- A slow playlist, a lit candle, and someone who’ll ask for seconds
