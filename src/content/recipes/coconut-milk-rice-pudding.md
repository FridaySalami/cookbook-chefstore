## Why You'll Love This

You ever want somethin’ sweet that don’t leave you feelin' heavy?  
This pudding’s **light**, **creamy**, and **naturally luscious** from coconut milk—no dairy needed.  
It’s the kind of cozy dish you make once, and end up thinkin' about all week.

Perfect warm on a rainy evening or chilled straight from the fridge on a hot day.

## Ingredients

- 150g [Ospiro Pudding Rice](https://www.thechefstoreuk.com/products/ospiro-pudding-rice-3kg)
- 400ml coconut milk (full-fat for extra creaminess)
- 200ml water
- 3 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Fresh mango, berries, or toasted coconut flakes, for serving (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine pudding rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and salt.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over low-medium heat, stirring often.
3. Cook uncovered for about 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the rice is tender and the mixture has thickened.
4. Stir in the vanilla extract.
5. Serve warm, or chill and top with fresh fruit or coconut flakes before serving.

## Tips

- Want it extra rich? Swap the 200ml water for more coconut milk.
- Prefer it sweeter? Add an extra spoonful of sugar or a drizzle of maple syrup after cooking.
- Flavor twist: Stir in a pinch of ground cardamom or cinnamon while it cooks.
