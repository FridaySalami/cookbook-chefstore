## Why You'll Love This

Soft, slow, and just sweet enough—this is rice pudding with sunshine in its bones.  
Coconut milk wraps the grains in silk. A whisper of vanilla carries through every spoonful.  
Whether you eat it warm with rain on the window or cold from the fridge in bare feet—this is the kind of pudding that knows how to comfort.


## Ingredients

- 150g Ospiro Pudding Rice  
- 400ml Coconut Milk (Full-Fat)  
- 200ml Water  
- 3 Tablespoons Sugar  
- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract  
- Pinch of Salt  
- Mango, Berries, or Toasted Coconut Flakes, For Serving (Optional)

## Instructions

1. **Combine and warm.**  
   In a medium saucepan, add the pudding rice, coconut milk, water, sugar, and a pinch of salt.  
   Stir gently and set over low-medium heat.

2. **Simmer gently.**  
   Bring it to a soft simmer. Let it bubble slowly—no rush—stirring often so the rice doesn’t catch at the bottom.

3. **Cook until creamy.**  
   After 25–30 minutes, the rice should be tender and the pudding thick enough to coat a spoon. If it looks too thick too soon, stir in a splash more water or coconut milk.

4. **Finish with vanilla.**  
   Turn off the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let it rest for 5 minutes it’ll thicken just a little more while it settles.

5. **Serve warm or chilled.**  
   Enjoy it warm right away, or cool and refrigerate for a cooler, creamier version. Add fruit or toasted coconut just before serving, if you like.

## Tips

- Swap the water for more coconut milk if you want it extra luxurious.  
- For more depth, stir in a pinch of ground cardamom or cinnamon while it simmers.  
- Leftovers keep well in the fridge add a splash of milk before reheating to loosen

## Goes Great With

- Slices of ripe mango or passionfruit  
- A sprinkle of pistachios or toasted almonds  
- A slow Sunday and a second helping
