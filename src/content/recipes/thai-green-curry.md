## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons Thai green curry paste
- 500g chicken breast, diced
- 400ml coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 100g baby corn
- 100g sugar snap peas
- Fresh Thai basil or coriander to garnish
- Steamed jasmine rice to serve

## Instructions

1. Heat a splash of oil in a deep pan or wok. Add the curry paste and let it sizzle for 1–2 minutes until your kitchen smells like a Thai street stall.
2. Toss in the diced chicken and cook until it starts to brown at the edges.
3. Pour in the coconut milk, stir gently, then add the fish sauce and sugar. Simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Add baby corn and sugar snap peas. Simmer for another 5 minutes, just until the veg is tender and bright.
5. Taste and adjust—maybe a splash more fish sauce, a pinch of sugar, or a squeeze of lime if you're feelin' zesty.
6. Serve hot over jasmine rice and top with fresh basil or coriander. Close your eyes and listen for tuk-tuks.

## Tips

- Want it hotter? Add a chopped green chili to the pan with the chicken.
- Out of chicken? Prawns, tofu, or aubergine work great.
- Leftover curry paste? Freeze it in an ice cube tray for next time.
