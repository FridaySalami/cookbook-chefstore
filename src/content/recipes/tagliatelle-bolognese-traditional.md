## Why You'll Love This

This ain’t spaghetti with meat sauce—it’s the real deal.  
Two types of mince, a slow sofrito, and a low simmer with stock and wine. This one’s all about **patience and depth**. Eat it slow, just like it cooks.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 1 carrot, finely chopped  
- 1 celery stick, finely chopped  
- 75g pancetta, finely diced  
- 250g veal mince  
- 250g pork mince  
- 100ml red wine  
- 2 tbsp tomato paste  
- 300ml chicken or vegetable stock  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- 300g tagliatelle  
- Grated Parmesan, to serve  

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add onion, carrot, celery, and pancetta. Sauté gently until soft and fragrant.
2. Add veal and pork mince. Break the meat apart and cook until sealed and the moisture has evaporated.
3. Pour in the red wine and cook for a minute or two until it mostly evaporates.
4. Stir in tomato paste and mix with 200–300ml stock to create a loose sauce consistency.
5. Cover the pan with a lid, reduce heat, and simmer gently for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
6. In the last 10 minutes, cook the tagliatelle in salted water until al dente. Reserve a splash of pasta water.
7. Add cooked pasta to the Bolognese with a little pasta water. Stir well to coat.
8. Serve hot, topped with freshly grated Parmesan.

## Tips

- Want deeper flavor? Use beef stock and cook the sauce for 2 hours.
- No veal? Substitute with beef mince.
- The sauce gets better the next day—leftovers = bonus.
