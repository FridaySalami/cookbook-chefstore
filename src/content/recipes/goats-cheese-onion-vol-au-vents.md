## Why You'll Love This

Ready in minutes but tastes like you spent hours.  
The crisp pastry, sweet onions, creamy cheese, and hint of thyme? It’s like every pub starter you’ve loved—only quicker, neater, and easier to scale up.

## Ingredients

- 6 Pidy Medium Vol Au Vents  
- 1 medium red onion, finely sliced  
- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter  
- 1 tsp brown sugar  
- 1 tsp balsamic vinegar  
- 100g goat’s cheese  
- Fresh thyme leaves or a pinch of dried thyme  
- Salt & pepper to taste  

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan).
2. Heat oil in a small pan. Cook onion gently with a pinch of salt until soft (about 8–10 mins).
3. Add sugar and balsamic vinegar. Stir and cook for 2–3 minutes until caramelised.
4. Spoon a little onion mixture into each vol-au-vent case.
5. Crumble goat’s cheese over the top and sprinkle with thyme.
6. Place on a baking tray and warm in the oven for 8–10 minutes, or until cheese is soft and tops are golden.
7. Serve warm or at room temperature.

## Tips

- Add a pinch of chilli flakes for a subtle kick.  
- Swap goat’s cheese for brie or blue cheese if you’re feelin’ bold.  
- Make ahead: prepare and store unbaked, then bake just before serving.
