			sourcing and delivering an ever growing cross-category product range. Growing from our local
			roots to serve discerning customers both near and far, we pride ourselves in providing high
			quality products, with exceptional service and at fantastic prices.</p> <p>Established in 2017 by Chichester born brothers Richard &amp; Ashley; Parkers Foodservice is a
			second-generation business following the retirement of their parents, Carol &amp; Andrew, after
			more than 30 years of running Premier Meats. Carol &amp; Andrew started the business as a husband
			&amp; wife duo on a small holding in Eastergate, West Sussex, selling poultry &amp; eggs to
			restaurants, caf√©s, and shops. A lot has changed over the years from our humble beginnings to
			where we are today as one of the fastest growing Foodservice providers on the South Coast.</p> <p>Based in Ford, just outside of Arundel, West Sussex, we offer an extensive range of items
			across frozen, ambient, chilled, dairy, hygiene, seasonal and butchery. Our fleet of
			refrigerated vans delivers directly from our warehouse 6 days a week, with no minimum order,
			throughout West Sussex and parts of Hampshire and Surrey. We live track all of our vehicles
			enabling us to accurately inform you of delivery times and proactively avoid traffic ensuring
			we get to you as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Our wonderful team here at Parkers Foodservice fulfils over 500 orders on a daily basis; we
			serve a diverse array of businesses and treat each customer with equal importance. We supply
			to restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, golf clubs, care homes, and the general public too.
			Alongside our dedicated teams directly serving our local commercial customers we also offer
			national delivery meaning no matter who you are, Parkers Foodservice is here to meet your
			every culinary need.</p></div></main>`;
