The spices don’t shout—they hum.  \nRose harissa adds a little mystery. Garlic does what garlic does. And every bite feels like something that’s doing more than just feeding you.\n\nIt’s plant-based, pantry friendly, and forgiving enough to make your own.  \nPut the pot on, let it bubble, and trust the house will start to smell like dinner.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  \n- 1 Onion  \n- 2 Garlic Cloves  \n- 1 Teaspoon Smoked Paprika  \n- 1/2 to 1 Teaspoon Chilli Flakes  \n- 1 Tablespoon Rose Harissa (Optional)  \n- 400g Tinned Chopped Tomatoes  \n- 400 to 500g Tinned Chickpeas  \n- 300ml Vegetable Stock  \n- 100g Spinach (Fresh or Frozen)  \n- Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n\n### Optional Finishes\n\n- Lemon Juice  \n- Coconut Cream  \n- Chopped Parsley  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Sauté the base**  \n   Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft and translucent.\n\n2. **Build the flavour**  \n   Stir in minced garlic, paprika, chilli flakes, and rose harissa if using. Cook for 1 minute until the kitchen smells like something good is happening.\n\n3. **Add the bulk**  \n   Pour in the chopped tomatoes, drained chickpeas, and vegetable stock. Stir well and bring to a simmer.\n\n4. **Simmer low and slow**  \n   Let it bubble gently for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will thicken and the flavours will settle into each other.\n\n5. **Add the greens**  \n   Stir in the spinach and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until wilted or heated through, depending on whether it's fresh or frozen.\n\n6. **Taste and finish**  \n   Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, a swirl of coconut cream, or some chopped herbs if desired.\n\n## Tips\n\n- For extra richness, add a spoon of tahini just before serving.  \n- Want it chunkier? Stir in roasted squash or sweet potato cubes.  \n- Leftovers thicken overnight and are even better the next day. Just add a splash of water to loosen when reheating.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Warm Flatbread or Garlic Toast  \n- Dollop of Yoghurt or Drizzle of Tahini  \n- A Big Blanket and a Slow Evening";
