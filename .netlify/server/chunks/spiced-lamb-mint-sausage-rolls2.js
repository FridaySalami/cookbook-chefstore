Make the Filling\n\n1. In a bowl, mix lamb, onion, garlic, spices, mint sauce, herbs, salt and pepper.\n2. Combine well but don’t overwork it—just enough to bring it together.\n\n### 2. Roll and Bake\n\n1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan).\n2. Unroll puff pastry and cut lengthwise into two long strips.\n3. Divide the lamb mixture in half and form into logs down the centre of each strip.\n4. Fold pastry over and seal edges with water. Place seam-side down.\n5. Cut into rolls, glaze with beaten egg, and sprinkle sesame seeds if using.\n6. Bake on parchment-lined tray for 20–25 minutes until golden and cooked through.\n\n### 3. Make the Dip\n\n1. Whisk together tahini, yoghurt, mint sauce, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt until smooth.\n2.
