It’s sticky. It hugs your insides.  \nThis banana bread doesn’t whisper “healthy”—it yells *“Have another slice.”*  \nDark chocolate melts into the crumb, walnuts add crunch, and the bananas do the heavy lifting on flavour and moisture.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 3 overripe bananas (the browner the better)  \n- 100g Tate & Lyle Soft Light Brown Sugar  \n- 2 eggs  \n- 75g unsalted butter, melted (or neutral oil)  \n- 1 tsp vanilla extract  \n- 200g plain flour  \n- 1 tsp baking powder  \n- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda  \n- Pinch of salt  \n- 100g Callebaut 45.4% Dark Chocolate Chunks  \n- 50g Buchanan Walnut Pieces, roughly chopped  \n- Optional: extra banana or sugar for topping\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Preheat oven to 170°C (fan). Grease and line a loaf tin.\n2. In a bowl, mash bananas well. Stir in sugar, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.\n3. In another bowl, mix flour, baking powder, bicarb, and salt.\n4. Combine wet and dry mixes until just combined—don’t overmix.\n5. Fold in chocolate chunks and walnuts.\n6. Pour into tin. Top with a halved banana or sprinkle of brown sugar if you like.\n7. Bake for 50–60 minutes, until golden and a skewer comes out with only a few sticky crumbs.\n8. Cool slightly before slicing (or don’t—we don’t judge).\n\n## Tips\n\n- Store wrapped at room temp for 2–3 days or freeze slices for later.\n- Toast leftovers and spread with butter or cream cheese.\n- Want it dairy-free? Use oil instead of butter and skip the chocolate (or use DF-friendly chunks).\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Coffee or a mug of chai  \n- Late breakfasts or midnight snacks  \n- A slice of peace on a loud day";
