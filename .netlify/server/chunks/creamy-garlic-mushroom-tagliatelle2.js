The mushrooms bring depth and softness. The garlic builds warmth, not sharpness. And the tagliatelle catches every drop of sauce in its silky ribbons.\n\nIt feels a little indulgent but never too much. A dinner that comes together in less than half an hour, yet still makes you slow down when you eat it.  \n\nWhether it’s the end of a long day or a quiet moment for yourself, this one says “You’re home now.” And that’s reason enough.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 250g Tagliatelle  \n- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  \n- 300g Mushrooms  \n- 3 Garlic Cloves  \n- 150ml Double Cream  \n- 50g Grated Cheese (Parmesan or Blend)  \n- 1 Teaspoon Fine Sea Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n- Fresh Parsley (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Cook the pasta.**  \n   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook until just al dente, following the packet time. Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining.\n\n2. **Sauté the mushrooms.**  \n   While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes until golden and tender. Stir occasionally so they colour evenly without steaming.\n\n3. **Add garlic and cream.**  \n   Turn the heat to low. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, just until fragrant. Pour in the double cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n4. **Combine with pasta.**  \n   Add the drained tagliatelle to the sauce. Toss gently to coat. If it looks too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water to loosen it to a silky consistency.\n\n5. **Stir in the cheese.**  \n   Add the grated cheese and stir through until melted. Let it rest for a minute or two off the heat so the sauce clings properly to the pasta.\n\n6. **Serve.**  \n   Divide between plates and scatter with chopped parsley if using. Add a final grind of black pepper on top.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use a mix of mushrooms for more flavour and texture  \n- Add a splash of white wine before the cream for extra depth  \n- A pinch of nutmeg works well stirred into the cream  \n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Rocket and parmesan salad with lemon dressing  \n- Garlic bread or focaccia  \n- A chilled glass of white wine or sparkling elderflower\n\n---\n> Simple enough to make on a Monday, comforting enough to feel like Saturday. Every strand carries flavour, warmth, and a little quiet joy.";
