Beat the eggs in a second bowl. In a third, combine the panko breadcrumbs with garlic powder, paprika, a pinch of salt, and black pepper.\n\n2. **Coat the chicken**  \n   Dip each piece of chicken into the flour, then the egg, then the seasoned panko. Press gently to help the coating stick.\n\n3. **Heat the oil**  \n   Pour vegetable oil into a deep pan to a depth of about 2 inches. Heat to 180°C or 350°F. The oil should sizzle gently when a breadcrumb is dropped in.\n\n4. **Fry the chicken**  \n   Fry the chicken pieces in batches for 2 to 3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the pan.\n\n5. **Rest and drain**  \n   Transfer cooked chicken to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Let rest a few minutes while you prep your dips.\n\n6. **Serve and enjoy**  \n   Pile onto a platter and serve hot with your choice of dipping sauces.\n\n## Tips\n\n- For even more crunch, double dip: egg, panko, egg again, and another layer of panko  \n- Want to bake instead of fry? Lightly oil the breaded bites and bake at 200°C for 20 minutes, flipping halfway  \n- You can freeze them after breading for a quick fry-up anytime\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Crispy fries or oven-roasted wedges  \n- Tucked into wraps with shredded lettuce and garlic sauce  \n- Game nights, lunchboxes, or impromptu kitchen picnics\n\n---\n\n> **Simple to make, hard to stop eating. These bites don’t just crunch, they sing.**";
