That “oh dang” sound?  \nThat’s panko magic.  \nThese chicken bites are light, crispy, and way better than anything in the freezer aisle.  \nPerfect for parties, kids’ dinners, or sneakin’ a few straight from the tray before anyone notices.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 2 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized chunks  \n- 1 cup Panko Breadcrumbs \n- 1/2 cup plain flour  \n- 2 large eggs, beaten  \n- 1 tsp garlic powder  \n- 1/2 tsp paprika  \n- Salt and pepper, to taste  \n- Vegetable oil, for frying  \n\n**Optional Dips:**  \n- Sweet chili sauce  \n- Honey mustard  \n- BBQ sauce  \n- Garlic mayo  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Set up three bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, one with panko breadcrumbs mixed with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.\n2. Dip each chicken piece first into flour, then egg, then panko, pressing lightly to coat.\n3. Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep pan to 180°C / 350°F.\n4. Fry chicken bites in batches for 2–3 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through.\n5. Drain on kitchen paper.  \n6. Serve hot with your favourite dipping sauces.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Want extra crunch? Double-dip: egg, panko, egg again, panko again.\n- Bake instead of frying? Spray with oil and bake at 200°C for about 20 minutes, flipping halfway.\n- Great for meal prep—freeze after breadcrumbing for quick fry-ups later.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Crispy fries or a side salad  \n- Stuffed into wraps with slaw  \n- Piled high for game night feasting";
