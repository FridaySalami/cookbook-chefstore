Once softened, drain and gently squeeze out excess moisture. Roughly chop if any pieces are large.\n\n2. **Start the polenta**  \n   In a saucepan, bring the water or stock to a gentle boil. Gradually pour in the polenta while whisking. Lower the heat and stir often until thick and creamy. This takes 5 to 7 minutes with quick-cook polenta, longer with traditional.\n\n3. **Enrich the base**  \n   Stir in the butter and Parmesan if using. Season with salt and black pepper. Keep warm on low heat while you finish the mushrooms.\n\n4. **Cook the mushrooms**  \n   Heat olive oil or butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for a minute until fragrant. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 4 to 5 minutes until golden and slightly crisp at the edges.\n\n5. **Bring it together**  \n   Spoon the polenta into bowls. Top with the warm mushrooms and a drizzle of Belazu Truffle Oil. Finish with extra Parmesan or a touch of flaky salt if you like.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Stir in a splash of cream to the polenta for extra richness  \n- A poached or fried egg on top turns this into a dreamy brunch or comfort dinner  \n- If using mushroom stock concentrate or glace, add a spoonful while cooking the mushrooms for more depth\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A peppery rocket salad with lemon dressing  \n- Crusty bread to catch every bit of sauce  \n- A dry red or a cold glass of white Burgundy and a quiet moment\n\n---\n\n> **Comfort that doesn't shout. Just warmth, flavour, and a little truffle for good measure.**";
