It just shows up warm, creamy, and familiar — like the dinners you grew up with but never quite wrote down. The kind you throw together on a weeknight and end up craving again by Friday.\n\nThe pasta is soft but not soggy. The sauce is thick and coats everything without being too heavy. Tuna brings depth. Sweetcorn brings a little pop of lightness. And the cheese? The cheese bubbles and browns, pulling everything together under a golden lid.\n\nYou can stretch it across a few meals. It reheats like a dream. And best of all, it feeds people without fuss. One tray, twenty minutes in the oven, and a whole lot of comfort in every bite.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 300g Pasta (Macaroni or Fusilli)  \n- 2 Tablespoons Butter  \n- 2 Tablespoons Plain Flour  \n- 500ml Milk  \n- 1 Teaspoon Dijon Mustard  \n- ½ Teaspoon Bonferme Fine Sea Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n- 2 x 145g Tins Tuna in Spring Water  \n- 150g Tinned Sweetcorn  \n- 100g Grated Cheese (plus extra for topping)  \n- Chopped Parsley or Chives (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Cook the pasta.**  \n   Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 2 minutes less than the packet time. This helps it hold its shape in the oven. Drain and set aside.\n\n2. **Make the sauce.**  \n   In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1 minute until smooth and slightly foamy. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes until thickened. Stir in the mustard, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.\n\n3. **Combine everything.**  \n   Stir the drained tuna and sweetcorn into the sauce. Add the grated cheese and stir until melted. Fold in the cooked pasta until everything is coated and combined.\n\n4. **Transfer and top.**  \n   Spoon the mixture into a baking dish. Spread it evenly. Sprinkle over a handful of extra cheese.\n\n5. **Bake.**  \n   Place the dish in a 200°C (fan 180°C) oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes. It should be bubbling and golden on top.\n\n6. **Rest and serve.**  \n   Let the bake sit for 5 minutes before serving. Top with chopped herbs if you’re using them.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add frozen peas, spinach, or a handful of chopped broccoli for more veg  \n- Swap tuna for cooked shredded chicken or smoked mackerel  \n- Leftovers can be frozen or stored in the fridge and reheated with a splash of milk\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A cucumber salad with dill and lemon  \n- Steamed broccoli or green beans  \n- Toasted garlic bread or buttered rolls\n\n---\n> A tray of something warm, simple, and exactly what the day calls for. No stress. Just dinner.";
