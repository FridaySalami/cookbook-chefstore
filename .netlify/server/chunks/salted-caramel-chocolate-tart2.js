Then comes the soft amber caramel smooth, deep, and just sweet enough. On top, a dark chocolate ganache that breaks with a gentle snap before melting on your tongue.\n\nIt’s sweet but not childish. Elegant but easy.  \nThe sea salt whispers through it all, making sure each bite is rich without being heavy.\n\nThis isn’t just dessert. It’s a pause in the evening. A reason to sit down. A reward, perhaps, for finishing a long week or simply for remembering to keep good chocolate in the cupboard.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 200g Digestive Biscuits  \n- 100g Unsalted Butter  \n- 300g Caramel Filling  \n- 150g Dark Chocolate (70 Percent Cocoa)  \n- 100ml Double Cream  \n- Flaky Sea Salt  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Make the base**  \n   Crush the biscuits to a fine crumb. Mix with the melted butter until evenly coated. Press into the base of a 9-inch tart tin, smoothing the surface with the back of a spoon. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up.\n\n2. **Prepare the caramel layer**  \n   Gently warm the caramel in a saucepan or microwave until it becomes pourable. Pour over the chilled biscuit base and spread evenly. Return to the fridge and chill for 20 minutes, or until slightly set.\n\n3. **Make the ganache**  \n   Heat the double cream in a small pan until it just begins to simmer. Remove from the heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 1 minute, then stir slowly until smooth and glossy.\n\n4. **Assemble the tart**  \n   Pour the ganache over the caramel layer. Tilt the tin gently to spread it into an even layer. Chill the tart in the fridge for at least 2 hours, or until fully set.\n\n5. **Finish and serve**  \n   Just before serving, sprinkle the top with flaky sea salt. Slice with a warm knife for clean edges.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Press the biscuit base up the sides of the tin for a crisper crust-to-filling ratio.  \n- Stir a pinch of salt directly into the caramel if you like it more savoury.  \n- Add a splash of whisky or rum to the ganache for a grown up twist.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A shot of espresso or strong brewed coffee  \n- A dollop of unsweetened whipped cream  \n- The kind of night that calls for something a little extra";
