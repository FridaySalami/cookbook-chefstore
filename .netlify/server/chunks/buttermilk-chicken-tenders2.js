The honey mustard dip? Sharp, sweet, and makes the whole thing sing.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### For the Chicken\n- 500g chicken breast or mini fillets  \n- 250ml buttermilk  \n- 1 tsp garlic powder  \n- 1 tsp smoked paprika  \n- Salt & pepper to taste  \n- 100g plain flour  \n- 100g breadcrumbs or panko  \n- Oil for shallow frying (if frying) or olive oil spray (if baking)  \n\n### For the Honey Mustard Dip\n- 3 tbsp Centaur Dijon Mustard  \n- 2 tbsp Hyve Squeezy Honey  \n- 1 tbsp mayonnaise or Greek yoghurt  \n- 1 tsp lemon juice (optional)  \n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Marinate the Chicken\n\n1. Cut chicken into strips if using breasts.\n2. In a bowl, mix buttermilk, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper.\n3. Add chicken and marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the fridge.\n\n### 2. Coat the Chicken\n\n1. Mix flour and breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl.\n2. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess, then coat in crumb mix.\n3. For extra crispiness, double-dip: back into buttermilk, then back into crumbs.\n\n### 3. Cook the Chicken\n\n#### 🧑‍🍳 Oven Method\n1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan). Line a tray with baking paper.\n2. Spray tenders with oil and bake for 18–22 minutes, turning once, until golden and cooked through.\n\n#### 🍳 Shallow Fry Method\n1. Heat 1–2cm of oil in a pan over medium heat.\n2. Fry tenders in batches for 3–4 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.\n3. Drain on kitchen paper.\n\n### 4. Make the Dip\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk mustard, honey, and mayo/yoghurt until smooth.\n2. Add lemon juice to brighten it up, if you like.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Great for batch cooking—freeze uncooked tenders, then bake straight from frozen.\n- Switch Dijon for wholegrain or American mustard for a milder dip.\n- Add cayenne to the coating if you like heat.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Fries or sweet potato wedges  \n- Crunchy slaw or pickles  \n- A night where nobody wants to wash up";
