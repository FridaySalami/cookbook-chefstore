Tangy, sweet, and a little bit addictive.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Chicken Tenders\n\n- 500g chicken breast or mini fillets  \n- 250ml buttermilk  \n- 1 tsp garlic powder  \n- 1 tsp smoked paprika  \n- salt  \n- pepper  \n- 100g plain flour  \n- 100g breadcrumbs or panko  \n- oil for shallow frying or olive oil spray  \n\n### Honey Mustard Dip\n\n- 3 tbsp Centaur Dijon Mustard  \n- 2 tbsp Hyve Squeezy Honey  \n- 1 tbsp mayonnaise or Greek yoghurt  \n- 1 tsp lemon juice (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Marinate the Chicken\n\n1. Cut chicken into strips if using breasts.\n2. In a bowl, mix buttermilk, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper.\n3. Add chicken and marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight in the fridge.\n\n### 2. Coat the Chicken\n\n1. Mix flour and breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl.\n2. Remove chicken from marinade, shake off excess, then coat in crumb mix.\n3. For extra crispiness, double-dip: back into buttermilk, then back into crumbs.\n\n### 3. Cook the Chicken\n\n#### 🧑‍🍳 Oven Method\n1. Preheat oven to 200°C (fan). Line a tray with baking paper.\n2. Spray tenders with oil and bake for 18–22 minutes, turning once, until golden and cooked through.\n\n#### 🍳 Shallow Fry Method\n1. Heat 1–2cm of oil in a pan over medium heat.\n2. Fry tenders in batches for 3–4 minutes per side, until golden and crispy.\n3. Drain on kitchen paper.\n\n### 4. Make the Dip\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk mustard, honey, and mayo/yoghurt until smooth.\n2. Add lemon juice to brighten it up, if you like.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Freeze breaded but uncooked tenders for a fast dinner later—bake from frozen at 200°C for 25–30 mins.\n- Use wholegrain mustard or yellow mustard for a milder dip.\n- Add cayenne to the crumb mix if you're craving a kick.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Fries or sweet potato wedges  \n- Crisp slaw or tangy pickles  \n- A no-fuss movie night or party platter spread\n\n---\n\n> **The kind of food that disappears before you’ve sat down. Just you, the tray, and whoever gets to it first.**";
