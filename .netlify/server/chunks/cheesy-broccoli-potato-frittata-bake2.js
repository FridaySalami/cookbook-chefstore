It’s soft inside with just enough crisp at the edges. The potatoes bring comfort. The broccoli adds brightness. The cheese does what cheese always does — holds it all together in a way that feels right.\n\nThere’s no pastry to fuss with, no flour to weigh out. Just eggs, cooked vegetables, and a bit of seasoning. It bakes quietly while you get on with everything else.\n\nIt’s a dinner that slides easily into lunchboxes. It feeds kids and grown-ups the same. And it tastes just as good cold from the fridge the next day with a bit of mustard or ketchup on the side.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 6 Eggs  \n- 2 Medium potatoes  \n- 1 Small head of broccoli  \n- 100g Cheddar cheese  \n- 1 Onion  \n- 1 Tablespoon Olive oil  \n- 1 Teaspoon Maldon Sea Salt  \n- Black pepper  \n- 1 Teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Preheat the oven to 200°C (fan 180°C).**  \n   Lightly grease a medium baking dish or line it with parchment.\n\n2. **Cook the potatoes and broccoli.**  \n   Peel the potatoes and cut into small cubes. Boil in salted water for 8 to 10 minutes until just tender. In the last 3 minutes, add the broccoli florets to the pot. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.\n\n3. **Soften the onion.**  \n   In a frying pan, warm the olive oil and gently cook the onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Let it cool for a minute before mixing in.\n\n4. **Whisk the eggs.**  \n   Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add salt, pepper, and mustard if using. Beat until smooth. Stir in the grated cheddar, then gently fold in the cooked vegetables and onion.\n\n5. **Pour into the baking dish.**  \n   Spread the mixture evenly in the dish. Give it a gentle shake to settle the top.\n\n6. **Bake until set and golden.**  \n   Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the centre is firm and the top is lightly browned. A knife inserted in the middle should come out clean.\n\n7. **Rest before serving.**  \n   Let it sit for 5 minutes so the structure holds. Slice into squares or wedges.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Swap broccoli for spinach, peas, or any greens you have on hand  \n- Add crumbled feta or diced ham if you want to bulk it out  \n- Leftovers can be chilled and eaten cold or gently reheated in a pan\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A crisp green salad or tomato slices  \n- Garlic bread or buttered toast  \n- A spoonful of ketchup, chutney, or mustard on the side\n\n---\n> Soft in the middle, golden on top. A dish that makes sense at any time of day.";
