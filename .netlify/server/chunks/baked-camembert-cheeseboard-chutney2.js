It’s spoonable. It’s got tang, warmth, and enough gooey charm to turn any table into a gathering.  \nThe chutney lifts the richness, the thyme adds a whisper of woodland, and the bread? That’s your shovel to scoop it all up.  \nOne bake and you’ll be hooked.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 1 whole Camembert\n- 2–3 tbsp Bay Tree Cheeseboard Chutney  \n- A few thyme sprigs (optional)  \n- Crusty bread, crackers, or toasted baguette, to serve\n\n## Instructions\n\n\n1. **Preheat your oven to 180°C (fan).**  \n   This allows the cheese to melt slowly and evenly.\n\n2. **Unwrap the Camembert and place it in the base of its wooden box.**  \n   Discard any plastic wrapping. If there’s no box, wrap the cheese in baking paper and foil to contain the melt.\n\n3. **Score the top of the rind with a sharp knife in a criss cross pattern.**  \n   This helps the heat reach the creamy centre and makes it easier to spoon once baked.\n\n4. **Set the box on a baking tray and bake for 15–20 minutes.**  \n   It’s ready when the middle feels soft and molten to the touch. If it starts to bulge or leak, you’re right on time.\n\n5. **Carefully remove from oven and spoon the chutney over the top.**  \n   Let the heat warm it through it’ll mingle with the cheese like old friends.\n\n6. **Scatter with thyme if using and serve immediately.**  \n   Get the bread in there while it’s hot and drippy.\n\n## Tips\n\n- **Tuck in garlic slivers** before baking for a mellow, roasted depth.  \n- **Drizzle with honey** before the oven for that sweet-meets-savoury hit.  \n- **Switch up the chutney** Bay Tree Spicy Onion Marmalade brings a sharper contrast.  \n- **Don’t overbake.** If it’s bubbling like lava and looks greasy, it’s gone too far.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A **chilled white wine** (Sauvignon Blanc or Chenin Blanc) or a **dry cider**  \n- **Pickles, charcuterie**, or even **roasted grapes** for a pop of sweetness  \n- A **fireside evening**, or as the **centrepiece of a Sunday spread**\n\n---\n\n> **Gather round, tear the bread, and let it drip.**  \n> Good food don’t always need cutlery just timing, company, and the right kind of mess.";
