Prepare the chicken  \nPlace the chicken breasts between sheets of cling film and gently flatten with a rolling pin. Season both sides with salt and black pepper.  \nSet up a breading station with three shallow bowls. Place the flour in one, the beaten egg in another, and the panko crumbs in the third.  \nDredge each piece of chicken in flour, then dip in egg, then coat in panko until fully covered.\n\n### 2. Fry the chicken  \nHeat 1 to 2 centimeters of oil in a wide frying pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot enough to sizzle a breadcrumb, add the chicken.  \nCook for 3 to 4 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.  \nTransfer to kitchen paper to drain and rest before slicing.\n\n### 3. Make the sauce  \nIn a small saucepan, stir the curry paste into the water or stock.  \nBring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\n### 4. Assemble the dish  \nSlice the rested chicken into strips. Serve over steamed rice, then pour the warm curry sauce generously over the top.  \nFinish with spring onions, sesame seeds, or shredded cabbage for a fresh crunch.\n\n## Tips\n\n- For a vegetarian version, swap the chicken for firm tofu or roasted sweet potato slices  \n- Add Japanese pickles or a simple slaw on the side to balance the richness  \n- Leftover curry sauce keeps well in the fridge or freezer for a speedy lunch\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Fluffy jasmine or sticky rice  \n- A cold beer or iced green tea  \n- Weeknights that need a bit of gold and crunch\n\n---\n\n> **It’s comfort food with a crisp edge. Simple, golden, and just the right amount of messy.**";
