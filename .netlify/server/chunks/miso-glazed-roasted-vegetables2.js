Cut the vegetables into bite sized pieces and scatter them across a large roasting tray. Keep the sizes fairly even so everything cooks at the same pace.\n\n2. **Mix the glaze**  \n   In a small bowl, whisk together the miso paste, olive oil, maple syrup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil if using. It should be thick enough to cling, thin enough to coat.\n\n3. **Dress the veg**  \n   Pour the glaze over the vegetables and toss thoroughly until every piece is coated. Use your hands or a spatula—just make sure the glaze finds every edge.\n\n4. **Roast to perfection**  \n   Place the tray in the oven and roast for 20 to 25 minutes. About halfway through, give the vegetables a good turn with a spatula. You want crisp edges and caramelised bits where the glaze meets heat.\n\n5. **Finish and serve**  \n   Once the veg is tender and golden, remove from the oven. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped herbs just before serving.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add a teaspoon of chili paste to the glaze if you want heat to balance the sweetness.  \n- Don’t overcrowd the tray if the veg are piled too high, they’ll steam instead of roast.  \n- This glaze works beautifully on aubergine, mushrooms, or halved Brussels sprouts.  \n- Leftovers? Tuck them into wraps, grain bowls, or even fold through cooked noodles.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Grilled salmon or crispy tofu  \n- Steamed jasmine or brown rice  \n- A soba salad with pickled veg and lime dressing  ";
