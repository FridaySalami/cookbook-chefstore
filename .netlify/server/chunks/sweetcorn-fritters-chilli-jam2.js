They’re fast, versatile, and deeply satisfying in that way only pan fried things can be. Serve them stacked high with a generous spoon of sweet chilli jam and a squeeze of lime and you’ve got the kind of snack that turns into a meal, or the kind of meal that disappears before it hits the table.\n\nThey’re crisp on the outside, pillowy in the middle, and bright with spring onion and herbs. A total fridge raider’s dream.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 300g Ballerina Tinned Sweetcorn  \n- 2 Spring Onions  \n- 1 Egg  \n- 75g Plain Flour  \n- 1⁄4 Teaspoon Baking Powder  \n- Salt and Pepper  \n- A Handful of Fresh Coriander or Parsley (optional)  \n- Oil for Frying  \n- Bay Tree Sweet Chilli Jam, to Serve  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Make the batter.**  \n   Tip the drained sweetcorn into a large mixing bowl. Add the sliced spring onions, egg, flour, baking powder, herbs if you're using them, and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together with a spoon or your hands—whatever gets you there. You’re looking for a thick, sticky batter that holds its shape on a spoon.\n\n2. **Heat the oil.**  \n   Drizzle a thin layer of oil into a wide frying pan and set it over medium heat. Give it a moment to warm up you're not deep-frying, just crisping the edges. The surface should shimmer slightly when it's ready.\n\n3. **Form the fritters.**  \n   Scoop heaped tablespoons of the batter and gently drop them into the pan. Flatten each one a little with the back of the spoon so they don’t end up too doughy in the centre. They should sizzle softly like a summer rain on a hot pavement.\n\n4. **Fry until golden.**  \n   Let the fritters cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes on one side. When they’re golden underneath and hold together when nudged, flip them gently with a spatula. Cook the other side until just as crisp. Cook in batches if needed don’t crowd the pan.\n\n5. **Drain and admire.**  \n   Transfer the fritters to a plate lined with kitchen paper. They’ll stay crisp while you finish the rest. Keep them warm in a low oven if you’re feeding a crowd or just delaying the joy.\n\n6. **Serve with flair.**  \n   Pile the fritters onto a platter or plate. Serve them hot, with Bay Tree Sweet Chilli Jam for dipping or dolloping. Maybe a squeeze of lime. Maybe nothing at all. They speak for themselves.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add crumbled feta or grated cheddar into the batter for a heartier snack.  \n- For a spicy version, stir in a little chopped fresh chilli or a pinch of smoked paprika.  \n- Cooked fritters freeze well. Reheat in the oven at 180°C for 10 to 15 minutes until crisp again.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A Crisp Herb Salad or Light Slaw  \n- Topped with Poached Eggs and a Spoonful of Yoghurt  \n- A Quiet Evening, a Good Film, and No Forks Required";
