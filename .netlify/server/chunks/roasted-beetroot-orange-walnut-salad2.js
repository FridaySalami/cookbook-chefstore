Each bite is a little contrast. A little harmony.\n\nThe rocket gives it that peppery lift, like it’s reminding you this is still a salad.  \nBut then comes the truffle oil, and suddenly everything softens. The dish leans into elegance. Into something you’d serve with linen napkins and a second glass of wine.\n\nIt’s earthy and vibrant. Classic but not boring.  \nWhether you serve it warm or chilled, on a weekday or a long-table Sunday lunch, it shows up with confidence.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 3 Medium Beetroots  \n- 2 Oranges  \n- 75g Walnut Pieces  \n- 2 Handfuls Rocket or Baby Spinach  \n- 1 Tablespoon Truffle Oil  \n- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  \n- 1 Teaspoon Honey  \n- Sea Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Roast the beetroot**  \n   Preheat your oven to 200°C. Peel the beetroot and cut into wedges. Toss with olive oil, a pinch of salt, and pepper. Spread out on a baking tray and roast for 40 to 45 minutes, flipping once, until tender and caramelised at the edges.\n\n2. **Toast the walnuts**  \n   While the beetroot roasts, add the walnut pieces to a dry frying pan over medium heat. Toast for 2 to 3 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden. Set aside to cool.\n\n3. **Segment and juice the oranges**  \n   Cut the peel and white pith off one orange, then segment by slicing between the membranes. Juice the second orange into a small bowl.\n\n4. **Make the dressing**  \n   Add honey, a pinch of salt, and the truffle oil to the orange juice. Whisk gently until it comes together into a glossy dressing.\n\n5. **Assemble the salad**  \n   Lay the rocket or spinach on a large serving platter. Scatter over the roasted beetroot, orange segments, and toasted walnuts.\n\n6. **Dress and finish**  \n   Drizzle with the citrus-truffle dressing. Add a final flick of truffle oil over the top if you want more depth. Serve immediately.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add thinly sliced red onion for sharpness or crumbled goat cheese for creaminess.  \n- No truffle oil? Use a fruity olive oil and top with shaved Parmesan.  \n- The beetroot can be roasted in advance and served cold the next day for an easy make-ahead option.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Warm crusty baguette or seeded rye  \n- Grilled halloumi or roast chicken  \n- A chilled glass of Riesling or Pinot Gris";
