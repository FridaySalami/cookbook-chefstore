Cook the Sea Bass\n\n1. Pat fillets dry and season the skin side with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.\n3. Place fish skin-side down and cook 3–4 minutes without moving.\n4. Flip and cook another 1–2 minutes until just cooked through.\n5. Remove and rest, skin-side up.\n\n### 2. Make the Sauce\n\n1. In the same pan, reduce heat to low.\n2. Add lemon juice, zest, garlic, and capers. Let it bubble gently.\n3. Whisk in butter until melted and emulsified.\n4.
