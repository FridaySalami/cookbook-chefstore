A lemon caper butter sauce that sizzles in the pan and wakes up every bite with sharpness, salt, and warmth.  \n\nIt’s fast, yet full of depth.  \nSimple, but nothing about it feels ordinary.  \nWhether it’s Tuesday night or dinner for someone special, this dish shows up with confidence and a bit of flair. It doesn’t need much—just good ingredients, a hot pan, and a little attention.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 2 Sea Bass Fillets (Skin On)  \n- Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  \n- 1 Tablespoon Butter  \n\n### For the Lemon Caper Butter\n\n- 30g Butter  \n- Juice of Half a Lemon  \n- Zest of 1 Lemon  \n- 1 Tablespoon Capers  \n- 1 Garlic Clove  \n- 1 Tablespoon Chopped Fresh Parsley  \n\n## Instructions\n\n### Cook the Sea Bass\n\n1. Pat the fillets dry with kitchen paper and season the skin side generously with salt and pepper.  \n2. Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.  \n3. Place the fillets skin side down into the hot pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes without moving them. The skin should crisp up and pull slightly away from the pan when ready.  \n4. Carefully flip the fillets and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more until just cooked through.  \n5. Transfer the fillets to a plate, skin side up, and let them rest while you make the sauce.\n\n### Make the Sauce\n\n6. Lower the heat. In the same pan, add the lemon juice, zest, capers, and garlic. Let it bubble for 30 seconds to release their aromas.  \n7. Add the butter and stir continuously as it melts and blends into the sauce.  \n8. Stir in the parsley and taste for seasoning. Spoon the sauce over the fish just before serving.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Serve with crushed new potatoes, buttered greens, or a crisp salad to balance the richness.  \n- If you don’t have capers, try chopped olives or a dash of anchovy paste for a similar savoury kick.  \n- For a dairy-free version, use all olive oil and add a little white wine to loosen the sauce.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Roasted Tenderstem Broccoli or Steamed Asparagus  \n- A Glass of Chilled Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio  \n- A night that deserves something easy and elegant on the table";
