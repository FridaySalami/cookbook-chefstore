The kind you eat slowly, even if you didn’t plan to.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 250g Mascarpone  \n- 300ml Double Cream  \n- 75g Icing Sugar  \n- 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract  \n- 250ml Strong Brewed Coffee, Cooled  \n- 2 Tbsp Coffee Liqueur (Optional)  \n- 200g Savoiardi Balocco Sponge Fingers  \n- Cocoa Powder, For Dusting\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Make the cream.**  \n   In a large bowl, whisk together the mascarpone, double cream, icing sugar, and vanilla extract.  \n   You’re aiming for soft peaks, thick and smooth enough to spread, but still gentle.\n\n2. **Mix the coffee soak.**  \n   In a shallow dish, combine the cooled coffee with the liqueur if you’re using it.  \n   Keep it close, you’ll need to move quickly when dipping.\n\n3. **Start layering.**  \n   Dip each sponge finger into the coffee mixture just for a second—enough to darken, not to collapse.  \n   Lay them snug in the base of a serving dish, breaking a few if you need to fill the gaps.\n\n4. **Add cream and repeat.**  \n   Spoon over half the mascarpone cream and smooth it out. Add another layer of dipped sponge fingers. Finish with the rest of the cream, spreading gently to the edges.\n\n5. **Chill.**  \n   Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours overnight is even better.  \n   This rest allows the layers to meld and the texture to settle into silk.\n\n6. **Dust and serve.**  \n   Just before serving, sift a thick blanket of cocoa powder over the top.  \n   Serve chilled, with spoons and silence.\n\n\n## Tips\n\n- Grate dark chocolate between layers for texture and a little bitter contrast.  \n- Make it in individual glasses for clean plating (and easier fridge storage).  \n- Use decaf coffee if little ones are joining in or if it’s a late-night bite.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A hot espresso or splash of amaretto  \n- A quiet night in and low lighting  \n- That last bite you eat slower than all the rest\n\n---\n\n> **A dish that’s soft without being shy. The kind you don’t rush. The kind you remember.**";
