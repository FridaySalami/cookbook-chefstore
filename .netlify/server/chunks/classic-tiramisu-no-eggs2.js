Soft sponge. Cool, whipped mascarpone.  \nThis is tiramisu stripped back to what matters—flavour, texture, and that last spoonful you always wish was bigger. And with no raw egg, it keeps cleaner and lasts longer.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 250g mascarpone  \n- 300ml double cream  \n- 75g icing sugar  \n- 1 tsp vanilla extract  \n- 250ml strong brewed coffee, cooled  \n- 2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional)  \n- 200g Savoiardi Balocco Sponge Fingers  \n- Cocoa powder, for dusting  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. In a large bowl, whisk mascarpone, cream, icing sugar, and vanilla until thick and smooth.\n2. In a shallow dish, combine coffee and liqueur (if using).\n3. Dip each Savoiardi briefly in the coffee mix—just enough to soak the outside but not go soggy.\n4. Layer soaked fingers into a dish, breaking to fit as needed.\n5. Spread half the mascarpone cream over the top. Repeat with a second layer of dipped fingers and finish with remaining cream.\n6. Chill for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.\n7. Dust generously with cocoa powder just before serving.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add grated dark chocolate between layers for texture.  \n- Make it in individual glasses for easy plating.  \n- Use decaf coffee if serving to kids.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A shot of espresso or amaretto  \n- After-dinner silence  \n- That one last spoon when no one’s looking";
