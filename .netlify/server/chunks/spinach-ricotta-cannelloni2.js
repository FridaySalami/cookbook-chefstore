Make it once—crave it often.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Filling\n- 250g ricotta\n- 200g fresh spinach (or frozen, thawed and squeezed dry)\n- 1 garlic clove, grated\n- Zest of 1 lemon\n- 1 egg yolk\n- 30g Parmesan or Pecorino, finely grated\n- Grated nutmeg\n- Salt & pepper\n\n### Tomato Sauce\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tbsp butter\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 2 garlic cloves, minced\n- 800g chopped tomatoes\n- Splash of white wine or balsamic vinegar\n- 1 tsp dried oregano or a sprig of thyme\n- 1 bay leaf\n- Salt & pepper\n- Pinch of sugar (optional)\n- 1 tbsp butter (to finish)\n\n### Assembly\n- 12 cannelloni tubes (or fresh pasta sheets)\n- 50g mozzarella or provolone\n- 30g Parmesan\n- Optional: herby breadcrumbs (breadcrumbs, olive oil, herbs)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Make the Sauce\n\n1. Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. The oil prevents the butter from burning, while the butter adds richness.\n2. Add the onion and cook gently for 8–10 minutes until soft and golden—this step builds natural sweetness and depth.\n3. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, just until fragrant.\n4. Deglaze with a splash of wine or balsamic—this lifts caramelised bits and adds complexity.\n5. Add chopped tomatoes, herbs, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed.\n6. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This reduces the sauce and deepens the flavour.\n7. Finish with 1 tbsp butter to mellow the acidity and create a velvety texture.\n\n### 2. Prepare the Filling\n\n1. If using fresh spinach, wilt it in a dry pan and squeeze out the water, then chop finely.\n2. Mix all filling ingredients in a bowl. The lemon zest brightens, the yolk binds, and the cheese adds depth. Season to taste.\n\n### 3. Prep the Pasta\n\n1. If using dry cannelloni tubes, blanch in boiling water for 3–4 minutes—this softens them and ensures even baking.\n2. If using fresh pasta sheets, cut into rectangles and roll the filling inside.\n\n### 4. Assemble\n\n1. Preheat oven to 180°C (fan).\n2. Spread a layer of sauce on the base of a baking dish—this prevents sticking and adds moisture.\n3. Fill tubes with ricotta mix using a piping bag or spoon. Don’t overfill—leave room to expand.\n4. Arrange in the dish and cover with remaining sauce.\n5. Top with grated cheese and optional herby breadcrumbs for texture.\n\n### 5. Bake\n\n1. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes—this gently steams the pasta.\n2. Uncover and bake 10–15 minutes more until golden and bubbling.\n3. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. This helps everything settle and hold together on the plate.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Can be assembled ahead and baked later.  \n- Add a béchamel layer on top for extra creaminess.  \n- Leftovers freeze and reheat beautifully.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Garlic bread or focaccia  \n- Rocket salad with balsamic  \n- A slow evening and a warm kitchen";
