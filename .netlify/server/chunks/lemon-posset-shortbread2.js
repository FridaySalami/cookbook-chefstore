Make the Posset\n\n1. In a saucepan, gently heat the cream and sugar until just simmering. Stir to dissolve.\n2. Once sugar is fully dissolved and the mix just starts to bubble, remove from heat.\n3. Stir in lemon zest and juice. The acid will thicken the cream.\n4. Pour into ramekins or glasses and chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.\n\n### 2. Make the Crumble\n\n1. Rub butter into flour with fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs.\n2. Stir in sugar and a pinch of salt.\n3. Bake at 180°C (fan) on a lined tray for 10–12 minutes or until golden. Cool, then crumble.\n\n### 3. Serve\n\nTop each posset with a spoonful of crumble just before serving for a contrast of textures.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add crushed berries or a raspberry coulis for colour and tartness.  \n- Swap lemon for lime or blood orange if you're feelin’ fancy.  \n- Store possets covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A crisp white wine  \n- Summer evenings or Sunday roast dessert rounds  \n- A quiet moment to yourself";
