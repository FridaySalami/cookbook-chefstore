Melt the Callebaut chocolate gently over a bain-marie (or in short microwave bursts), stirring until smooth. Let it cool slightly.\n2. Whisk the egg yolks into the cooled chocolate one at a time until glossy.\n3. In another bowl, whip the double cream until soft peaks form.\n4. In a third bowl, whisk egg whites with the sugar and pinch of salt until stiff peaks form.\n5. Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture.\n6. Carefully fold in the egg whites, trying not to knock out too much air.\n7. Spoon into small glasses or ramekins.  \n8. Chill for at least 2 hours before serving. Top with extra cream, chocolate shavings, or berries if you’re feeling fancy.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Don’t rush the folding—slow and gentle wins the race.\n- Want a deeper flavor? Stir a splash of espresso or coffee liqueur into the melted chocolate.\n- Make ahead: mousse keeps beautifully for 24–48 hours in the fridge.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- After a rich curry or roast dinner  \n- Paired with a crisp glass of sparkling wine  \n- Quiet evenings when the house finally goes still";
