And the best part? It comes together with barely a fuss.  \n\nNo baking. No stress. Just melt, mix, and chill.  \nWhether it’s a Tuesday treat or the closing note to a dinner with friends, this mousse holds its own, light as air and deeply satisfying.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 200g Milk Chocolate Callets  \n- 300ml Double Cream  \n- 2 Large Eggs  \n- 2 Tablespoons Sugar  \n- A Pinch of Salt  \n\n### Optional Garnishes\n\n- Shaved Chocolate  \n- Fresh Raspberries  \n- Crushed Biscuits  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Melt the chocolate**  \n   Place the chocolate callets in a heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water. Stir gently until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.\n\n2. **Add the egg yolks**  \n   Once the chocolate has cooled slightly, stir in the egg yolks one at a time until fully incorporated. The mixture should look glossy and thick.\n\n3. **Whip the cream**  \n   In a separate bowl, whip the double cream to soft peaks. It should hold shape but still feel billowy.\n\n4. **Beat the egg whites**  \n   In a third bowl, whisk the egg whites with the sugar and a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form. The mixture should stand tall on the whisk.\n\n5. **Fold in the cream**  \n   Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture using a spatula. Take your time, small circles, soft hands.\n\n6. **Fold in the egg whites**  \n   Add the beaten egg whites in two batches, folding carefully to keep the mixture light and airy.\n\n7. **Chill the mousse**  \n   Spoon into small ramekins or glasses and place in the fridge to chill for at least 2 hours, or until set.\n\n8. **Serve and garnish**  \n   Just before serving, top with cream, shaved chocolate, berries, or a crumble of biscuits—whatever brings you joy.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Let the chocolate cool slightly before adding the yolks to avoid scrambling them.  \n- Don’t rush the folding this is what keeps the mousse light.  \n- Add a splash of espresso or a teaspoon of liqueur to the melted chocolate for a deeper finish.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- After a roast or slow cooked stew  \n- A flute of sparkling wine or glass of dessert sherry  \n- Candlelight and quiet conversation, or a late-night kitchen raid";
