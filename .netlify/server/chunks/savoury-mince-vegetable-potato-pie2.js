Something familiar, but never boring. It comes out of the oven golden and bubbling, steam lifting in little clouds, carrying the smell of something steady and kind.\n\nYou’ve got a savoury base of mince and soft vegetables cooked down into a rich sauce. Carrots bring sweetness. Courgette disappears gently into the background. A few peas scatter like dots of colour and comfort. And then, on top, a layer of smooth, buttery mash that crisps lightly where the heat kisses it.\n\nThere’s no trick to it. Just good ingredients, a bit of quiet stirring, and a bake that knows how to feed people without needing to impress. It’s the kind of thing you make once and keep coming back to, especially when the world outside feels a little much.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 500g Beef mince  \n- 1 Onion  \n- 2 Garlic cloves  \n- 2 Carrots  \n- 1 Courgette  \n- 100g Frozen peas  \n- 1 Tablespoon Tomato purée  \n- 400ml Beef stock  \n- 1 Teaspoon Maldon Sea Salt  \n- Black pepper  \n- 1 Teaspoon Worcestershire sauce  \n- ½ Teaspoon Smoked paprika  \n- 1 Tablespoon Olive oil  \n- 750g Potatoes  \n- 30g Butter  \n- 50ml Milk\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Boil the potatoes.**  \n   Peel and chop the potatoes into even pieces. Place in a pot of cold salted water. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 15 to 18 minutes until soft. Drain well and mash with the butter and milk. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.\n\n2. **Prepare the vegetables.**  \n   Grate the carrots and courgette. Finely dice the onion and garlic. Set everything near the hob so it’s ready to go when the pan is hot.\n\n3. **Brown the mince.**  \n   In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the beef mince and cook until browned, breaking it up as it cooks.\n\n4. **Build the base.**  \n   Stir in the tomato purée, grated vegetables, smoked paprika, salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and meld with the mince.\n\n5. **Simmer the sauce.**  \n   Pour in the beef stock and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly and everything tastes like it belongs together. Stir in the peas right at the end.\n\n6. **Assemble the pie.**  \n   Spoon the mince mixture into a baking dish. Spread the mashed potato over the top, smoothing to the edges. Use a fork to gently rough up the surface — this helps the top brown beautifully in the oven.\n\n7. **Bake until golden.**  \n   Place in a preheated oven at 200°C (fan 180°C) and bake for 25 minutes until golden and bubbling at the edges.\n\n8. **Let it rest.**  \n   Take it out of the oven and give it 5 minutes before serving. The layers will settle slightly and the flavours will hold together better on the plate.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add a splash of balsamic vinegar or a pinch of sugar to the sauce if you like a deeper sweetness  \n- Swap the beef mince for turkey, lamb, or lentils to suit what you’ve got  \n- Leftovers reheat well and can be frozen in portions for a rainy day\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Steamed green beans or buttered peas  \n- A sharp salad with mustard dressing  \n- Gravy or brown sauce, if that’s how your house likes it\n\n---\n> A pie that doesn’t ask for much. Just a quiet oven, a steady spoon, and a table that feels like home.";
