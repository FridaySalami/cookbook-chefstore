You flip them with confidence. And when the maple syrup hits the top of that warm stack, you know it was worth getting out of bed.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 2 Cups All-Purpose Flour  \n- 2 Tablespoons Sugar  \n- 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder  \n- ½ Teaspoon Baking Soda  \n- ½ Teaspoon Salt  \n- 2 Cups Buttermilk (Or Milk Plus 1 Tablespoon Vinegar)  \n- 2 Large Eggs  \n- ¼ Cup Unsalted Butter, Melted  \n- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Combine the dry ingredients**  \n   In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n\n2. **Mix the wet ingredients**  \n   In a separate bowl or jug, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well blended.\n\n3. **Bring it together**  \n   Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a spatula or spoon until just combined. The batter should be thick and lumpy. Do not overmix.\n\n4. **Heat the pan**  \n   Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a little butter or oil. Let it melt and begin to sizzle softly.\n\n5. **Cook the pancakes**  \n   Pour about ¼ cup of batter per pancake onto the hot surface. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until bubbles form on top and the edges begin to look set. Flip and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.\n\n6. **Serve hot**  \n   Stack onto warm plates. Serve immediately with your favorite toppings.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Real buttermilk brings the best tang and texture  \n- Add a pinch of cinnamon or lemon zest for extra brightness  \n- Leftovers freeze well. Reheat in the toaster for quick, cozy mornings\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Crispy Bacon or Veggie Sausages  \n- Berries and a Dollop of Yoghurt  \n- A Cup of Strong Coffee and Nowhere to Be\n\n---\n\n> **Pancakes like these don’t need occasion. They make the occasion.**";
