Creamy white chocolate. A fudgy, golden blondie base that walks the line between soft and chewy.  \nThese feel like something from a childhood bake sale but with just enough grown-up flourish to bring them proudly to a dinner party.  \nThey’re simple, nostalgic, and exactly the kind of thing that disappears before the kettle’s even boiled.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 170g Unsalted Butter, Melted  \n- 220g Light Brown Sugar  \n- 2 Large Eggs  \n- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract  \n- ½ Teaspoon Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract  \n- 200g Plain Flour  \n- 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder  \n- Pinch of Salt  \n- 100g Glace Cherries, Halved  \n- 150g Callebaut White Chocolate Callets\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Prepare your tin**  \n   Preheat the oven to 180°C or 160°C fan. Line a 20cm square tin with parchment, leaving some overhang for easy lifting later.\n\n2. **Blend the butter and sugar**  \n   In a mixing bowl, stir together the melted butter and brown sugar until it looks glossy and rich like warm caramel.\n\n3. **Add the eggs and extracts**  \n   Whisk in the eggs one at a time. Then stir through the vanilla and almond extract until smooth and thick.\n\n4. **Mix the dry ingredients**  \n   In another bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add this to the wet mixture and fold gently until just combined. Don’t overmix or you’ll lose the fudgy texture.\n\n5. **Add the fun stuff**  \n   Toss the halved cherries in a little flour (this stops them sinking). Fold them into the batter with the white chocolate callets.\n\n6. **Spread and smooth**  \n   Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. It doesn’t have to look perfect—it’ll settle as it bakes.\n\n7. **Bake to perfection**  \n   Bake for 22 to 25 minutes. You’re looking for golden edges and a centre that’s just set. A skewer should come out with moist crumbs, not raw batter.\n\n8. **Cool and slice**  \n   Let cool completely in the tin. Lift out using the parchment and slice into squares.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Scatter flaked almonds on top before baking for extra crunch and almond depth  \n- Swap cherries for dried cranberries or chopped apricots if you fancy a twist  \n- These freeze well wrap individually and freeze for up to 2 months\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A Strong Builder’s Tea or Vanilla Latte  \n- An Afternoon Bake Sale or Sweet Little Picnic  \n- Warm Custard When You’re Feeling Naughty\n\n---\n\n> **Soft, sweet, a little sticky at the edges these blondies are a love letter to the bottom of the biscuit tin.**";
