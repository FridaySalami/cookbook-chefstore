The apricots melt in with just enough sweetness to lift it. The almonds crunch back, and the pomegranate molasses ties it all together with a shimmer of tang.  \nIt’s balanced, earthy, and quietly bold. Serve it warm, serve it cool, serve it like you made it for someone you care about.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 200g Centaur Greenwheat Freekeh, Rinsed  \n- 1 Small Onion  \n- 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil  \n- 600ml Vegetable Stock or Water  \n- 8 to 10 Dried Apricots  \n- 50g Flaked Almonds  \n- 1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin  \n- ½ Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon  \n- Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n- 1 Tablespoon Belazu Pomegranate Molasses, Plus Extra To Drizzle  \n- Fresh Parsley or Mint, To Garnish\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Soften the aromatics**  \n   Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent.\n\n2. **Bloom the spices**  \n   Stir in the cumin and cinnamon. Let them cook for 30 seconds until the oil smells warm and spiced.\n\n3. **Toast the freekeh**  \n   Add the rinsed freekeh to the pan. Stir to coat the grains in oil and toast for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\n4. **Simmer until tender**  \n   Pour in the stock or water. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to low, cover, and simmer for 30 to 35 minutes. The freekeh should be tender with a little bite and the liquid mostly absorbed.\n\n5. **Add the fruit and nuts**  \n   Stir in the chopped dried apricots and toasted flaked almonds. Cover and let it sit for 5 minutes off the heat so the flavours can meld.\n\n6. **Season and finish**  \n   Add salt, pepper, and the pomegranate molasses. Taste and adjust as needed. Another splash of molasses or grind of pepper can bring it into balance.\n\n7. **Serve with care**  \n   Spoon into a wide bowl or platter. Scatter with chopped parsley or mint. Finish with a slow drizzle of pomegranate molasses for shine and sharpness.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use vegetable stock for a vegan version or swap for chicken stock if preferred  \n- Toast the almonds in a dry pan for 2 to 3 minutes until golden for deeper flavour  \n- This dish is delicious warm but also makes a great chilled mezze option the next day\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Labneh or Greek Yoghurt with Za’atar and Olive Oil  \n- Warm Flatbreads or Toasted Pita  \n- A Crisp Tomato and Cucumber Salad With Lemon Juice and Mint\n\n---\n\n> **A dish full of texture, contrast, and calm. It knows when to speak up and when to simply be.**";
