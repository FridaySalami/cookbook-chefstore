Keep them spread out for better browning.\n\n2. **Whisk up the glaze.**  \n   In a small bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, honey, oil, and sea salt. Stir until it looks syrupy and glossy this will coat everything with flavour.\n\n3. **Add sausages and coat.**  \n   Tuck the sausages among the grapes and shallots. Pour over the glaze and gently toss everything to get a good coating. Add thyme if using.\n\n4. **Roast for 35–40 minutes.**  \n   Turn sausages halfway through. You’re aiming for golden skins, blistered grapes, and shallots soft enough to yield to a spoon.\n\n5. **Serve in the tray, juices and all.**  \n   Bring it to the table hot. Dunk bread into those sticky, savoury sweet juices or spoon over mash like it’s gravy with flair.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Figs make a great seasonal swap for grapes add them in the last 10 minutes to avoid mush.  \n- For veggie sausages, reduce cooking time by 5–10 minutes and avoid overcrowding the tray.  \n- A last minute drizzle of balsamic can brighten the flavours right before serving.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Creamy polenta or mash for a soft, rich base  \n- A bitter leaf salad with mustard vinaigrette to cut through the sweetness  \n- Crusty sourdough or ciabatta something sturdy enough to swipe up the juices\n\n---\n\n> **Sticky edges. Jammy middles. No need for knives—just a good loaf and good company.**";
