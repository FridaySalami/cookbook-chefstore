They’re chewy where it counts, golden around the edges, and just the right kind of nostalgic.  \nPerfect with a hot cuppa or tucked into a lunchbox for later. And maybe even better the next day—if they last that long.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 250g Porridge Oats  \n- 125g Unsalted Butter  \n- 125g Tate & Lyle Squeezy Golden Syrup  \n- 100g Buchanan Sultanas  \n- 75g Glace Cherries, Halved  \n- 50g Light Brown Sugar  \n- Pinch of Salt\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Preheat and prep**  \n   Preheat the oven to 160°C fan. Line a 20cm square baking tin with parchment paper.\n\n2. **Melt the base**  \n   In a saucepan over low heat, melt the butter, golden syrup, and sugar together. Stir gently until smooth and combined.\n\n3. **Mix in the dry ingredients**  \n   Remove from the heat. Stir in the oats, salt, sultanas, and cherries. Mix until all the oats are glossy and the fruit is evenly distributed.\n\n4. **Fill the tin**  \n   Spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Press it down firmly with the back of a spoon to level and compact the surface.\n\n5. **Bake**  \n   Bake for 22 to 25 minutes until golden around the edges and lightly set in the centre.\n\n6. **Cool and slice**  \n   Let the flapjacks cool completely in the tin. Once firm, lift out and cut into bars or squares.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add dried apricots, cranberries, or mixed seeds for more texture  \n- For chewier flapjacks, bake for the shorter time and cool fully before slicing  \n- Store in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze in portions for grab-and-go snacking\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A Mug of Strong Tea or Fresh Coffee  \n- Packed Lunches or Picnic Hampers  \n- A Light Drizzle of Melted Dark Chocolate on Top (Highly Recommended)\n\n---\n\n> **Not fancy. Just right. Sweet, chewy, and ready when you are.**";
