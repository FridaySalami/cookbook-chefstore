The orange blossom is floral and fleeting. And the sea salt? That’s the detail you didn’t know you needed.  \nIt’s a dessert that doesn’t shout. It whispers. And it lingers.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 150g Dark Chocolate (70 Percent), Chopped  \n- 250ml Double Cream  \n- 1 Tablespoon Nielsen-Massey Orange Blossom Water  \n- 1 Tablespoon Sugar (Optional, To Taste)  \n- Maldon Sea Salt Flakes, To Finish\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Heat the cream**  \n   Pour the cream into a small saucepan and place over low heat. Warm gently until it begins to steam around the edges but do not let it boil.\n\n2. **Add the chocolate**  \n   Remove the pan from heat and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for a full minute to begin melting in the warmth.\n\n3. **Stir slowly**  \n   Using a spoon or spatula, stir the mixture until smooth and glossy. Add the orange blossom water and stir again. Taste and add sugar if you want a slightly softer finish.\n\n4. **Divide and chill**  \n   Pour the chocolate mixture into ramekins, espresso cups, or small glasses. Let them cool slightly at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours until set with a gentle wobble.\n\n5. **Finish and serve**  \n   Just before serving, sprinkle each pot with a few flakes of Maldon sea salt. Keep it delicate. A little goes a long way.\n\n## Tips\n\n- These are rich, so small portions really do go the distance  \n- For added depth, stir in a splash of coffee liqueur or a drop of almond extract  \n- Garnish with candied orange peel, crushed pistachios, or dark chocolate shards  \n- Serve with a crisp biscuit or a spoonful of crème fraîche to cut through the richness\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A glass of tawny port, sweet sherry, or strong espresso  \n- A short silence between friends who don’t need to fill the air  \n- The feeling of something simple done beautifully\n\n---\n\n> **Dark, floral, and just a little bit daring — these pots don’t need attention. They earn it.**";
