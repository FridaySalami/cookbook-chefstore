Heat sesame oil and neutral oil in a pan over medium-high heat.\n2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n3. Stir in chopped kimchi. Cook for 2–3 minutes until slightly caramelised and reduced.\n4. Add rice and break it up with a spatula. Stir-fry for 5–6 minutes until heated through and lightly crispy.\n5. Stir in soy sauce and gochujang if using. Toss to coat evenly.\n6. In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up until whites are set and yolks are runny.\n7. Plate the rice, top with fried eggs, and garnish with spring onions, sesame seeds, and extras if desired.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use **day-old rice** for best texture—it fries better than freshly cooked rice.\n- Add chopped bacon, tofu, or leftover roast meats if you like.\n- Want it vegan? Skip the egg and top with avocado or crispy tofu cubes.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Pickled cucumber or radish  \n- A mug of broth or miso soup  \n- A night when fridge odds and ends need a new lease on life";
