It’s sharp and sizzling and totally unapologetic.  \nAnd sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 1 Tbsp Sesame Oil  \n- 1 Tbsp Neutral Oil (Sunflower or Vegetable)  \n- 2 Garlic Cloves  \n- 150g Kimchi  \n- 250g Cooked Rice  \n- 1 Tbsp Dark Soy Sauce  \n- 1 Tsp Gochujang (Optional)  \n- 2 Eggs  \n- Spring Onions  \n- Sesame Seeds  \n- Optional: Nori Flakes, Toasted Peanuts, Sriracha\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Start with the sizzle**  \n   Heat the sesame oil and neutral oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Let it get hot enough that a tiny piece of garlic would dance.\n\n2. **Wake the garlic**  \n   Add the garlic, minced fine. Stir it gently for 30 seconds until fragrant. It should smell sweet and sharp, not burnt. If it browns, the heat’s too high—turn it down.\n\n3. **Cook the kimchi down**  \n   Add the chopped kimchi. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes until it softens and caramelises a little. This tames its bite and brings out the sweetness hidden inside.\n\n4. **Add the rice**  \n   Tip in the cold rice. Use a spatula to break it apart and toss it with the kimchi. Press it gently into the pan every so often to crisp the edges. Stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes until it’s steaming hot with golden flecks.\n\n5. **Season with soy and spice**  \n   Pour in the soy sauce. If using gochujang, stir that in too. Toss everything until the rice is evenly coated and just glossy enough to catch the light.\n\n6. **Fry the eggs**  \n   In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up. Cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. You want that golden spill to soak into the rice later.\n\n7. **Assemble and finish**  \n   Divide the rice between bowls. Slide a fried egg on top of each. Scatter with sliced spring onions, sesame seeds, and any extras you like—nori, peanuts, or a sharp drizzle of sriracha.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Cold rice is your best friend here. Freshly cooked rice turns mushy. Let it chill in the fridge for at least a few hours first.\n- Use up what you have. Leftover roast meat, a few mushrooms, or cubes of tofu all work brilliantly stirred in before the egg.\n- For a vegan version, skip the egg and top with avocado slices or pan-fried tofu. Add a splash of lime for contrast.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Pickled cucumber or daikon for crunch and contrast  \n- A small bowl of miso soup or broth to sip between bites  \n- A quiet evening that needs waking up with spice ";
