It’s creamy. It’s got layers of soft, savoury leeks tucked between thin potato slices.  \nThe top turns golden with bubbling cheese and crunchy panko, and the sage brings just enough warmth to make you want seconds.  \nServe it as a side or don’t. It holds its own as a main, just fine.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 500g Potatoes  \n- 2 Leeks  \n- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter  \n- 100ml Essential Cuisine Vegetable Stock  \n- 200ml Kerrymaid UHT Double Cream  \n- 100g grated cheese  \n- 2 tbsp Centaur Panko Breadcrumbs  \n- ½ tsp Chef William Dried Sage  \n- Salt  \n- Black pepper  \n- 1 garlic clove (optional)  \n- Pinch of nutmeg (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan).**  \n   Grease a medium baking dish so nothing sticks when it bubbles up.\n\n2. **Cook the leeks.**  \n   Heat the oil or butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and cook gently for 6–8 minutes until soft. If using garlic, add it in the last minute for mellow flavour.\n\n3. **Mix the cream base.**  \n   In a jug, combine the cream, vegetable stock, dried sage, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Stir until smooth.\n\n4. **Layer it up.**  \n   Arrange half the sliced potatoes in the baking dish. Top with half the cooked leeks and a sprinkle of cheese. Repeat with remaining potatoes, leeks, and cheese.\n\n5. **Pour and top.**  \n   Pour the cream mixture evenly over the layers. Scatter panko breadcrumbs over the top. Add a final dusting of cheese if you like a crustier finish.\n\n6. **Bake covered.**  \n   Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. This steams the potatoes and infuses them with flavour.\n\n7. **Bake uncovered.**  \n   Remove the foil and return to the oven for 15 minutes until the top is golden, crisp, and bubbling at the edges.\n\n8. **Rest before serving.**  \n   Let the gratin sit for 5 minutes. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve clean portions.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add chopped cooked bacon or torn ham between layers for a smoky twist.  \n- For a plant-based version, swap cream and cheese for dairy-free alternatives and use olive oil.  \n- Stir a teaspoon of mustard into the cream mixture for an extra depth of flavour.  \n- If slicing potatoes ahead, keep them in cold water to stop browning—just pat dry before layering.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Roast chicken or sausages  \n- A bitter green salad with vinaigrette  \n- A second helping and your softest socks\n\n---\n\n> **Golden on top, soft in the middle—like all the best things in life.**";
