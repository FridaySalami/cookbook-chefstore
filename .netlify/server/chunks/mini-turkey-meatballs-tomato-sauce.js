Light, tender, and full of gentle flavour, they simmer quietly in a sauce that tastes like it’s been made before—by someone who cared what kind of day you had.</p> <p>The meatballs are small enough for little hands, soft enough for cautious eaters, and clever enough to carry vegetables without making a fuss about it. They get a touch of cheese, a pinch of spice, and a slow bake so they hold together without getting tough.</p> <p>The sauce starts slow too. Onions melting into oil, garlic softening into sweetness, tomato paste catching just slightly before the splash of vinegar brings it back into balance. It’s the kind of sauce that makes the kitchen smell like home, even if the day didn’t start that way.</p> <p>This is a dinner that doesn’t shout. It holds you gently. It feeds without fanfare. And it gives you just enough quiet to hear the sound of forks scraping plates at the end.</p> <h2>Ingredients</h2> <ul><li>400g Turkey mince</li> <li>1 Onion</li> <li>1 Garlic clove</li> <li>1 Small carrot or courgette</li> <li>30g Breadcrumbs</li> <li>1 Egg</li> <li>30g Parmesan cheese</li> <li>1 Teaspoon Maldon Sea Salt</li> <li>Black pepper</li> <li>1 Teaspoon Dried oregano</li> <li>¼ Teaspoon Fennel seeds or smoked paprika</li> <li>2 Tablespoons Olive oil</li> <li>1 Onion</li> <li>2 Garlic cloves</li> <li>2 Tablespoons Tomato paste</li> <li>400g Chopped tomatoes</li> <li>1 Teaspoon Sugar</li> <li>1 Teaspoon Balsamic vinegar</li> <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li> <li>A few Basil leaves</li> <li>Parmesan and Lemon wedges (to serve)</li></ul> <h2>Instructions</h2> <ol><li><p><strong>Heat the oven to 200°C (fan 180°C).</strong><br> Line a baking tray with parchment. This keeps things tidy and helps the meatballs brown evenly without sticking.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Soften the aromatics for the meatballs.</strong><br> Finely chop one onion and one garlic clove. Warm a drizzle of oil in a pan and cook them gently for 5 to 7 minutes until soft. You want sweetness, not colour. Let them cool slightly before using.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Prepare the meatball mix.</strong><br> Grate the carrot or courgette and squeeze out any excess moisture. In a large bowl, combine the turkey mince with the cooled onion mixture, grated veg, breadcrumbs, egg, Parmesan, salt, pepper, oregano and fennel seeds or paprika. Mix gently with clean hands until just combined. Don’t overwork it or they’ll tighten up.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Shape and bake.</strong><br> Roll the mix into small balls—about walnut-sized—and arrange them on the tray. Bake for 15 minutes. They should be just golden and lightly firm to the touch.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Start the sauce while they bake.</strong><br> In a wide pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the second onion, chopped finely, and cook slowly until soft and translucent. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Build depth in the sauce.</strong><br> Add the tomato paste to the onions. Stir it through and let it cook for 1 to 2 minutes to deepen the flavour. Splash in the balsamic vinegar and scrape the bottom of the pan—it’ll lift the flavour and clean the base.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Simmer the tomatoes.</strong><br> Add the chopped tomatoes and sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Let it bubble gently for 10 minutes, uncovered, until the sauce thickens and softens.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Add the meatballs.</strong><br> Gently lower the baked meatballs into the sauce. Simmer together for 10 more minutes so the flavours meld and the meatballs stay tender.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Finish the sauce.</strong><br> Stir in the butter at the end. It rounds the sauce, softens the acidity, and gives a silky finish. Add torn basil if using.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Let the pan rest before serving.</strong><br> Take it off the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. This helps everything settle and makes serving cleaner and easier.</p></li></ol> <h2>Tips</h2> <ul><li>For extra softness, soak the breadcrumbs in a splash of milk before adding to the mix</li> <li>You can blend the sauce if your family prefers it smooth</li> <li>Make a double batch of meatballs and freeze half for next week</li></ul> <h2>Goes Great With</h2> <ul><li>Spaghetti or tagliatelle</li> <li>Garlic bread or crusty rolls</li> <li>A fresh salad with lemon dressing</li> <li>Grated Parmesan and a squeeze of lemon to finish</li></ul> <hr> <blockquote><p>The kind of dinner that brings everyone to the table and gives them reason to stay a little longer.</p></blockquote>`;
