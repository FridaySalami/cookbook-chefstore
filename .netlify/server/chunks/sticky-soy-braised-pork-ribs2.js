Every inch is soaked in a dark, glossy glaze that clings to your fingers and leaves its mark on your soul.  \n\nSoy, garlic, ginger and just enough sweetness to round it out. A little five spice if you’re feeling generous.  \nThey taste like you spent all day in the kitchen, but with the right method, you barely have to.\n\nOven or pressure cooker, these ribs always show up bold.  \nMake a big batch. There won’t be leftovers, but if there are, they get better by the hour.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 1.2kg Pork Ribs (Baby Back or Spare Ribs)  \n- 4 Tablespoons Dark Soy Sauce  \n- 2 Tablespoons Light Soy Sauce  \n- 2 Tablespoons Rice Wine Vinegar  \n- 2 Tablespoons Honey or Brown Sugar  \n- 1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil  \n- 1 Tablespoon Neutral Oil  \n- 4 Garlic Cloves  \n- 1 Thumb-Sized Piece of Ginger  \n- 1 Teaspoon Five Spice Powder (Optional)  \n- 250ml Water or Chicken Stock  \n- 2 Spring Onions  \n- 1 Teaspoon Sesame Seeds (Optional)  \n- Optional: 1 Teaspoon Chilli Oil or Fresh Red Chilli  \n\n## Instructions\n\n### Oven Method (Low and Slow)\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 160°C (fan) or 180°C (conventional).  \n2. Heat neutral oil in a large, deep ovenproof pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the ribs in batches until golden brown on all sides.  \n3. Add the garlic (smashed), ginger (sliced), both soy sauces, rice vinegar, honey or sugar, sesame oil, five spice powder, and water or stock. Stir to combine and bring to a gentle simmer.  \n4. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or foil. Transfer to the oven and braise for 2 hours, turning the ribs once halfway through.  \n5. Uncover and return to the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. This step helps the sauce reduce and become beautifully sticky.  \n6. Remove from the oven, garnish with chopped spring onions, sesame seeds, or fresh chilli if using. Serve hot.\n\n### Pressure Cooker Method (Fast and Furious)\n\n1. Set your pressure cooker or Instant Pot to sauté mode. Add neutral oil and sear the ribs until browned all over.  \n2. Add garlic, ginger, soy sauces, vinegar, honey, sesame oil, five spice, and stock. Stir well.  \n3. Lock the lid and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.  \n4. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release any remaining steam.  \n5. Remove the lid, switch back to sauté mode, and simmer uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes to reduce the sauce. Stir occasionally until it becomes thick and glossy.  \n6. Garnish and serve hot.\n\n## Tips\n\n- For extra caramelisation, place the cooked ribs under a hot grill for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.  \n- Leftover ribs? Shred the meat and use in bao buns, rice bowls, or noodle salads.  \n- No five spice? No problem. The dish holds its own with just the soy, garlic, and ginger.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Steamed Jasmine Rice or Coconut Rice  \n- Crunchy Asian Slaw or Pickled Vegetables  \n- Soft Bao Buns or Lettuce Wraps  \n- Sticky Noodles with Sesame and Soy";
