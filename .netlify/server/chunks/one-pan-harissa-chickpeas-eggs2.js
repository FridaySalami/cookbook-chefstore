It hits the pan and blooms into something deep and floral and just the right kind of spicy.\n\nThe chickpeas soak up that sauce like they were made for it. The tomatoes simmer into something thick and soulful.  \nAnd the eggs? They sit like quiet passengers until the heat sets their whites and leaves their yolks soft and golden, ready to run through the dish.\n\nIt’s comfort without heaviness. Spice without drama.  \nOne pan, no stress, just a spoon, some bread, and the kind of food that feels like home even if you’ve never had it before.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil  \n- 1 Small Onion  \n- 2 Garlic Cloves  \n- 1 Teaspoon Ground Cumin  \n- 2 Tablespoons Rose Harissa  \n- 400g Chopped Tomatoes or Passata  \n- 400 to 500g Tinned Chickpeas  \n- Salt  \n- Black Pepper  \n- 3 to 4 Eggs  \n- Fresh Parsley or Coriander  \n- Bread for Serving  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Begin the base**  \n   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 to 6 minutes until it’s soft, golden at the edges, and smelling sweet.\n\n2. **Add aromatics**  \n   Stir in the garlic and cumin. Cook for 1 minute, just enough to take the raw edge off the garlic and wake up the spice.\n\n3. **Build the flavour**  \n   Add the rose harissa and cook for another minute, stirring gently. It should darken slightly and smell full and fragrant.\n\n4. **Simmer the stew**  \n   Pour in the tomatoes and chickpeas. If the sauce feels thick, add a small splash of water. Season with salt and pepper. Let everything simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring every so often, until the sauce thickens and tastes rich.\n\n5. **Add the eggs**  \n   Make little dips in the sauce and crack in the eggs. Cover the pan with a lid or foil and let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft. Check gently by touching the whites near the yolk with a spoon.\n\n6. **Finish and serve**  \n   Sprinkle over chopped parsley or coriander. Serve straight from the pan with warm bread for scooping.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Add a handful of spinach or kale before the eggs go in for extra greens.  \n- For a creamy finish, swirl in a spoonful of yoghurt right at the end.  \n- Make it vegan by skipping the eggs and topping with avocado slices or pan-fried tofu.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- Toasted sourdough, garlic flatbread, or naan  \n- A spoon of labneh or plain yoghurt on the side  \n- A slow morning or a quick dinner that needs soul";
