You don’t need a queue.  \nJust a mug, a minute, and a reason to pause.\n\nThe best part? You can tailor every sip. Make it bold, light, extra whipped, dairy free, spiked, or spiced.  \nHowever you serve it, it feels like a small luxury. And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n- 100ml Strong Brewed Coffee or 2 Shots Espresso  \n- 2 Tablespoons Salted Caramel Syrup  \n- 1 Tablespoon Chocolate Syrup or White Chocolate Sauce  \n- 250ml Milk  \n- Whipped Cream (Optional)  \n- Flaky Sea Salt (Optional)  \n\n## Instructions\n\n1. **Brew the coffee**  \n   Make your espresso or strong brewed coffee and pour it into a small saucepan or heatproof jug while hot.\n\n2. **Add the syrups**  \n   Stir in the salted caramel and chocolate syrup. Let them melt into the coffee, turning it smooth and fragrant.\n\n3. **Warm the milk**  \n   Heat the milk in a small pan or using a milk frother until steamy but not boiling. If you like foam, whisk or froth to your heart’s content.\n\n4. **Bring it together**  \n   Pour the flavoured coffee into your favourite mug. Top with the hot milk and stir gently to combine.\n\n5. **Top and finish**  \n   Spoon whipped cream over the top if using. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt for a little sparkle. Sip slow and savour.\n\n## Tips\n\n- To make it iced, let the coffee cool completely. Shake all the ingredients with ice and pour over chilled milk.  \n- Try swapping the syrups—use Toffee Nut, Cinnamon, or Pumpkin Spice for seasonal spins.  \n- Add a splash of Irish cream liqueur or bourbon for a grown-up version worth staying in for.\n\n## Goes Great With\n\n- A soft blanket and a storm outside  \n- Chocolate cookies or shortbread on the side  \n- A slow morning that doesn’t need to start just yet";
